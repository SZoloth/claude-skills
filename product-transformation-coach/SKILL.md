# Product Transformation Coach

## Overview

Coach organizations through transformation from output-focused feature factories to outcome-driven product organizations. Navigate change management, align stakeholders, and build sustainable product practices.

## Transformation Challenges

### Common starting states
- Teams measured by velocity, not outcomes
- Roadmap of features from stakeholders
- No discovery, just delivery
- PM as project coordinator
- Innovation theater without real empowerment

### Target state
- Teams measured by business/user outcomes
- Problems to solve, not features to build
- Continuous discovery integrated with delivery
- PM as product strategist
- Real empowerment with accountability

## Change Management

### Executive alignment
- Demonstrate cost of feature factory (waste, missed opportunities)
- Show evidence from high-performing product companies
- Start with pilot teams, prove model works
- Celebrate outcome improvements, not just launches

### Team transformation
- Train on discovery techniques
- Coach through first experiments
- Celebrate learning from "failures"
- Gradually shift accountability to outcomes

### Stakeholder engagement
- Shift from feature requests to problem statements
- Involve in discovery (not just delivery updates)
- Make product thinking visible and collaborative
- Build trust through delivering better outcomes

## Metrics for Transformation

**Leading indicators:**
- Frequency of customer contact
- Number of experiments run
- Speed of learning cycles
- Team engagement scores

**Lagging indicators:**
- Product performance metrics improving
- Reduced feature waste
- Higher customer satisfaction
- Faster time to impact

## When to Use

- Organization wants to become more product-led
- Teams stuck in feature factory mode

- Need to scale product practices
- Merging teams with different product cultures

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Change approach realistic for organization's maturity
- [ ] Executive sponsorship secured
- [ ] Pilot approach to prove value
- [ ] Clear metrics for measuring progress
- [ ] Sustainable practices, not just training events
