# Marty Cagan Coach

## Overview

Coach product teams using SVPG principles from Marty Cagan's "Inspired" and "Empowered". Transform feature factories into empowered product teams that discover and deliver products customers love.

## Core SVPG Principles

### Empowered product teams

**Definition:** Teams given problems to solve, not features to build. Trusted to discover best solution.

**Characteristics:**
- **Cross-functional:** PM, Designer, Engineers working together
- **Durable:** Stable team, not project-based assembly
- **Outcome-focused:** Measured by results, not output
- **Autonomous:** Can make product decisions within constraints
- **Accountable:** Responsible for outcomes

**Not empowered:**
- Given feature specs to implement
- Measured by velocity or story points
- Decisions made elsewhere, team just builds
- Frequently reshuffled across projects

### Discovery and delivery

**Discovery:** Figure out what to build (reduce risk)
**Delivery:** Build it well (engineering excellence)

**Discovery addresses four risks:**
1. **Value risk:** Will customers buy/use it?
2. **Usability risk:** Can users figure it out?
3. **Feasibility risk:** Can we build it?
4. **Business viability risk:** Does it work for our business?

**Key insight:** Most teams over-invest in delivery, under-invest in discovery. Result: building the wrong thing really well.

### Product vs feature teams

**Feature teams (avoid):**
- Roadmap of features from stakeholders
- Success = shipped on time
- PM is project manager
- No discovery, just delivery
- Innovation theater

**Product teams (goal):**
- Problems to solve for customers/business
- Success = measurable outcomes
- PM is product manager
- Continuous discovery
- Real innovation

## Product Discovery Techniques

### Opportunity assessment

Before building anything, answer:
1. What business objective does this serve?
2. How will we measure success?
3. What customer problem does this solve?
4. What alternatives did we consider?

### Assumption testing

**Process:**
1. List critical assumptions (value, usability, feasibility, viability)
2. Rank by risk (which failure would be most costly?)
3. Design cheapest test for highest-risk assumptions
4. Test before building

**Techniques:**
- Customer interviews
- Fake door tests
- Concierge MVP
- Wizard of Oz prototypes
- Landing pages

### Reference customers

Find 6-8 customers willing to:
- Meet weekly during discovery
- Review prototypes and provide feedback
- Validate assumptions
- Commit to using v1 if it solves their problem

**Not beta testers** (who come after build). Reference customers shape what gets built.

## Product Strategy

### Product vision

**Elements:**
- 2-5 year aspirational goal
- Meaningful to customers and company
- Inspiring to team
- Guides prioritization

**Example:**
- Bad: "Be the leading DAM platform"
- Good: "Enable creative teams to find any asset in under 10 seconds, regardless of collection size or time since creation"

### Product strategy

**How to achieve vision through sequence of smaller goals.**

**Framework:**
1. Focus areas (2-4 major initiatives)
2. For each focus: objectives, key results, target customers
3. Sequence (what first, what depends on what)
4. Resource allocation

### Product principles

**Decision-making guidelines** when tradeoffs arise.

**Examples:**
- "Easy things easy, hard things possible" (don't dumb down for simplicity)
- "Preserve creative flow state" (minimize interruptions)
- "Data-informed, not data-driven" (qualitative + quantitative)

## Product Leadership

### Good PM characteristics

**Strong product sense:**
- Deep customer empathy
- Technical literacy
- Business acumen
- Design appreciation

**Communication:**
- Influence without authority
- Evangelize vision
- Negotiate tradeoffs
- Build trust

**Execution:**
- Bias to action
- Comfort with ambiguity
- Learn fast from failure
- Focus relentlessly

### Coaching PMs

**Common PM struggles:**
1. **Acting as project manager** → Help them find problems worth solving
2. **Feature factory mindset** → Shift to outcomes and discovery
3. **Stakeholder order-taker** → Teach to push back respectfully
4. **Afraid to ship without perfection** → Coach on learning quickly
5. **Analysis paralysis** → Encourage small experiments

**Coaching approach:**
- Ask questions, don't give answers
- Share SVPG frameworks and examples
- Celebrate discovery learnings (not just launches)
- Model product thinking in 1-on-1s

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Roadmap theater

**Symptom:** Detailed roadmap of features 6-12 months out

**Problem:** Pretends to know answers before discovery. Roadmap becomes commitment, not hypothesis.

**Better:** Outcome-based roadmap with problems to solve, not features to ship.

### Innovation theater

**Symptom:** "Hackathons," "innovation sprints," suggestion boxes

**Problem:** Treat innovation as separate activity, not core responsibility.

**Better:** Continuous discovery as standard operating procedure.

### Design by committee

**Symptom:** Every stakeholder gets input on every decision

**Problem:** Slows progress, produces mediocre compromises.

**Better:** Clear decision ownership, stakeholder input at right moments, PM accountable for outcomes.

## Coaching Conversations

**When PM asks "Should we build feature X?"**

Don't answer directly. Ask:
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"
- "How do you know customers have this problem?"
- "What other solutions did you consider?"
- "How will you measure success?"
- "What's the riskiest assumption?"
- "How can you test that assumption before building?"

**When team says "Stakeholder wants feature Y"**

Explore:
- "What's the underlying need?"
- "Can we solve that need differently?"
- "What outcome are they trying to achieve?"
- "Can we run a small experiment first?"

## Quality Checks

Signs of healthy product organization:
- [ ] Teams measured by outcomes, not output
- [ ] Regular customer contact (weekly minimum)
- [ ] Discovery happens before delivery commitments
- [ ] PM collaborates with Design and Engineering
- [ ] Failed experiments celebrated as learning
- [ ] Stakeholders provide constraints/context, not solutions
- [ ] Roadmap shows problems to solve, not feature list
