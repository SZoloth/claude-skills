# Stakeholder Analyst

## Overview

Understand stakeholder psychology, motivations, and communication preferences to craft effective influence strategies. Navigate organizational dynamics and build support for product initiatives.

## Stakeholder Mapping

### Key dimensions to understand:

**1. Power and influence**
- Decision authority (can say yes/no)
- Informal influence (shapes others' opinions)
- Resource control (budget, team, access)

**2. Interest and impact**
- How much does this affect them?
- What do they care about?
- What are their success criteria?

**3. Support level**
- Champion (active advocate)
- Supporter (passive agreement)
- Neutral (don't care)
- Skeptic (needs convincing)
- Blocker (active opposition)

### Stakeholder profiles

For each key stakeholder, document:
- Role and responsibilities
- Success metrics and incentives
- Communication preferences
- Decision-making style
- Risk tolerance
- Past experiences relevant to this initiative
- Concerns and objections
- What would make them a champion

## Communication Strategies

### For champions
- Keep informed early and often
- Enlist as advocates to influence others
- Leverage their credibility
- Ask for specific help

### For skeptics
- Understand root concerns
- Address objections with evidence
- Find common ground
- Start small, build trust
- Don't oversell or dismiss concerns

### For blockers
- Identify true objection (often not stated reason)
- Understand what success looks like for them
- Find win-win if possible
- Escalate if blocking without valid reason
- Work around if necessary

## Influence Tactics

### Build credibility
- Deliver on commitments
- Show domain expertise
- Bring customer evidence
- Acknowledge risks honestly

### Frame for audience
- CFO: ROI, cost reduction, efficiency
- Engineering: Technical elegance, reduced debt
- Design: User experience, delight
- Sales: Revenue impact, competitive advantage

### Timing matters
- Plant seeds early
- Don't surprise with big asks
- Give time to process
- Know when to push vs wait

### Coalition building
- Find natural allies
- Address influencers first
- Create social proof
- Make support visible

## Difficult Conversations

### Delivering bad news
1. Lead with bottom line (don't bury)
2. Explain what happened
3. Share what you learned
4. Propose next steps
5. Ask for input

### Pushing back on stakeholder requests
1. Clarify underlying need
2. Propose alternatives
3. Show tradeoffs explicitly
4. Let stakeholder make informed choice
5. Document decision

### Navigating conflict
- Separate people from problem
- Focus on interests, not positions
- Generate options together
- Use objective criteria
- Know your BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)

## Meeting Preparation

### Before important meetings:

**1. Define success**
- What decision do we need?
- What information must be shared?
- What concerns addressed?

**2. Anticipate objections**
- What will skeptics say?
- How will we respond?
- What evidence needed?

**3. Prepare materials**
- Pre-read if needed (24-48 hours advance)
- Slides focused on decision, not exhaustive
- Backup details ready but not presented

**4. Plan meeting flow**
- Who speaks when?
- How much time per section?
- When to ask for decision?

## When to Use

- Preparing for high-stakes meetings
- Need to build support for initiative
- Facing resistance or opposition
- Crafting strategic communications
- Navigating organizational politics
- Recovering from setback or failure
