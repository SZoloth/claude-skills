# Post-Interview Synthesis Checklist

Complete this checklist **immediately after** each JTBD interview (10 minutes max).

## 1. Complete Timeline ✓

- [ ] All 6 stages populated in timeline template
- [ ] Four forces (Push, Pull, Anxiety, Habit) noted for each stage
- [ ] Dates/anchors recorded for each stage
- [ ] Context notes explain what was happening

**If incomplete:** Schedule 15-min follow-up while details are fresh.

## 2. Extract Verbatim Quotes ✓

Capture 3-5 key quotes that reveal positioning (why they said it, not just what):

1. Quote that reveals **Push** (pain of status quo):
   >

2. Quote that reveals **Pull** (attraction/hope):
   >

3. Quote that reveals **Anxiety** (fear/risk):
   >

4. Quote that reveals **Habit** (inertia):
   >

5. Quote that reveals **time wall** or trigger:
   >

## 3. Classify Adoption Path ✓

**Path A: Drip→Trigger**
- [ ] Cadence of demos/docs/peer success observed
- [ ] Series-like learning journey formed
- [ ] Specific time wall triggered adoption

**Path B: Deep Dive→Unlock**
- [ ] Binge-read or shadowed complete workflow
- [ ] Hit gated step (requires integration/permission/TD)
- [ ] Requested access and adopted quickly

**Selected path:** _____________

## 4. Tag Trigger Type ✓

What made this go from "someday" to "now"?

- [ ] **Milestone** - Show calendar gate (kickoff, turnover, freeze, delivery)
- [ ] **Outage/deprecation** - Legacy tool broke or sunset announced
- [ ] **Policy change** - Security requirement, compliance, mandate
- [ ] **Pilot window** - Limited access slots, TD bandwidth constraint
- [ ] **Peer proof** - Saw another team succeed, FOMO effect
- [ ] **Other:** _____________

**Primary trigger:** _____________

## 5. Log Artifacts ✓

Link all concrete evidence:

**Jira/ShotGrid tickets:**
-

**Confluence pages:**
-

**Slack threads:** (channel + date or link)
-

**Version tags/asset IDs:**
-

**Meeting notes/demos:**
-

## 6. Measure Enablement Metrics ✓

**Request date:** _____________

**First successful use date:** _____________

**Enablement lag:** _____ days/weeks

**First run success rate:**
- [ ] Success on first attempt
- [ ] Failed first attempt (describe issue): _____________

## 7. Identify Patterns ✓

**Blockers encountered:**
-

**Enablers that accelerated:**
-

**Stakeholder dynamics:** (who pushed, who hesitated, who enabled)
-

**Alternatives considered:**
-

## 8. Convert to Predictions ✓

Based on this interview, what would we predict?

**If we...**
[action/change]

**Then we expect...**
[adoption behavior/metric change]

**Example predictions:**
- "If we announce pilot windows 4-6 weeks ahead in #department-updates, passive lookers will convert at higher rates"
- "If we shorten integration enablement to ≤2 days, active lookers will convert before next milestone"

**This interview suggests:**
-

## 9. Next Steps ✓

- [ ] Share timeline with interviewer partner for review
- [ ] Add insights to department synthesis document
- [ ] Schedule follow-up if anchors missing
- [ ] Interview additional roles (TD/production) if needed
- [ ] Update adoption path tracking for WBR
- [ ] Contribute to cross-interview pattern analysis

## 10. Quality Check ✓

Before closing synthesis:

- [ ] Can reconstruct the decision timeline from notes alone?
- [ ] Have specific dates, people, artifacts referenced?
- [ ] Identified clear time wall or trigger?
- [ ] Captured forces that reveal causality (not just description)?
- [ ] Distinguished real behavior from hypotheticals?
