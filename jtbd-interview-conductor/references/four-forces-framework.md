# Four Forces Framework

The four forces explain why people switch from one solution to another. Every adoption decision involves a push-pull tension between forces that promote change and forces that resist it.

## The Four Forces

```
        Forces FOR Change
        ─────────────────
              ↓
    [Push]  →  [Pull]

Status Quo  ←→  New Solution

    [Anxiety] ← [Habit]
              ↑
        Forces AGAINST Change
        ─────────────────────
```

### Force 1: Push (Pain of Status Quo)

The dissatisfaction or pain with the current solution that creates desire for change.

**Questions to reveal Push:**
- "What made the current way unacceptable?"
- "When did that pain spike?"
- "What broke or took too long?"
- "How did it show up in your day/week?"

**DWA examples:**
- "Can't find the right asset version during turnover"
- "Review feedback gets lost in Slack threads"
- "Manual steps take 2 hours per shot"
- "Tool crashes when working with large files"
- "Can't track what's approved vs in-progress"

**Characteristics of strong Push:**
- Specific, measurable pain (time, errors, frustration)
- Recent spike or escalation
- Affects job performance or deadlines
- Creates visible problems for team/downstream

**Weak Push signals:**
- Vague dissatisfaction ("it could be better")
- Theoretical problems ("might be an issue someday")
- Low-frequency pain (happens once a year)
- Easy workarounds exist

### Force 2: Pull (Attraction to New Solution)

The appeal, promise, or hope that the new solution offers.

**Questions to reveal Pull:**
- "What did you hope this would let you do that you couldn't before?"
- "Which moment or example convinced you it was worth trying?"
- "What did you see others doing that looked appealing?"

**DWA examples:**
- "Saw another sequence finish turnover in half the time"
- "Demo showed automatic version tracking"
- "Documentation promised one-click asset updates"
- "TD said it would eliminate manual exports"
- "Peer showed how it solved the same problem"

**Characteristics of strong Pull:**
- Concrete capability demonstrated
- Credible proof (demo, peer success)
- Addresses specific Push pain
- Clear before/after improvement

**Weak Pull signals:**
- Vague promises ("should be better")
- No concrete proof ("marketing says...")
- Doesn't address main pain point
- Generic benefits that don't resonate

### Force 3: Anxiety (Fear of New Solution)

The doubts, uncertainties, and risks that create hesitation about adopting the new solution.

**Questions to reveal Anxiety:**
- "What risks or unknowns almost stopped you?"
- "Who was worried and about what?"
- "What would have made this feel safe sooner?"
- "What could have gone wrong?"

**DWA examples:**
- "Worried it wouldn't work with our show's pipeline"
- "Concerned about learning curve during crunch"
- "TD said integration could take weeks"
- "Security review might block it"
- "No rollback plan if it breaks our workflow"
- "What if it doesn't handle our file sizes?"
- "Will it work with vendor deliveries?"

**Characteristics of high Anxiety:**
- Show-critical risk (deadline, quality, pipeline)
- Uncertainty about effort/time required
- Past experience with failed adoptions
- Lack of proof in similar context
- Irreversible commitment required

**Reducing Anxiety:**
- Pilot/trial on non-critical work
- Rollback plan clearly documented
- TD/security pre-approval obtained
- Peer success in similar context
- Time buffer before critical milestone

### Force 4: Habit (Inertia of Status Quo)

The comfort, familiarity, and investment in the current solution that creates resistance to change.

**Questions to reveal Habit:**
- "What would you have done if nothing changed?"
- "Who prefers the old path and why?"
- "What ties you to existing tools/checkpoints?"
- "How much training would the new way require?"

**DWA examples:**
- "Everyone knows the Shotgun workflow by heart"
- "Scripts and automation built around old tool"
- "Templates in legacy format"
- "Muscle memory from 5 years using it"
- "Existing work would need migration"
- "Team conventions assume old workflow"
- "Comfortable with workarounds"

**Characteristics of strong Habit:**
- Years of practice/expertise invested
- Automation/scripts tied to old way
- Team conventions and standards
- Sunk cost in training/setup
- Network effects (everyone else uses it)

**Breaking Habit:**
- New solution mimics familiar patterns
- Migration path preserves past work
- Training fits into existing schedules
- Peer adoption creates new normal
- Old way becomes deprecated/unsupported

## How Forces Interact

### Switching Occurs When:

```
(Push + Pull) > (Anxiety + Habit)
```

Change happens when combined forces FOR change outweigh combined forces AGAINST change.

### Common Patterns

**High Push + Low Pull = Frustrated but stuck**
- Pain is real but no compelling alternative
- Results in workarounds, not adoption
- Opportunity: demonstrate Pull credibly

**Low Push + High Pull = Interesting but not urgent**
- New thing looks cool but no pressing need
- Results in "someday" thinking, not action
- Opportunity: reveal latent Push

**High Anxiety + Low Habit = Blocked despite interest**
- Want to switch but too risky/uncertain
- Results in pilot limbo, endless questions
- Opportunity: reduce risk, provide proof

**Low Anxiety + High Habit = Comfortable mediocrity**
- No pain, no risk, but also no improvement
- Results in "if it ain't broke" resistance
- Opportunity: create time wall or peer pressure

## Evolution Across Timeline Stages

Forces change intensity as decision progresses:

### First Thought
- **Push:** Pain becomes conscious
- **Pull:** Vague awareness of alternatives
- **Anxiety:** Not yet considered
- **Habit:** Dominant force

### Passive Looking
- **Push:** Pain persists, maybe intensifies
- **Pull:** Exposure to demos, docs, peer stories
- **Anxiety:** Starts to form questions
- **Habit:** Still comfortable

### Active Looking
- **Push:** Pain now blocking progress
- **Pull:** Concrete proof seen (demo, peer success)
- **Anxiety:** Questions get specific
- **Habit:** Inertia starts to crack

### Decision
- **Push:** Critical threshold crossed (time wall)
- **Pull:** Concrete capability confirmed
- **Anxiety:** Mitigated enough (pilot, approval)
- **Habit:** Overcome by urgency

### First Use
- **Push:** Immediate feedback on whether pain relieved
- **Pull:** Reality vs expectations
- **Anxiety:** Real risks surface
- **Habit:** Old patterns still tempting

### Ongoing Use
- **Push:** New pains may emerge
- **Pull:** New benefits discovered
- **Anxiety:** Reduced with experience
- **Habit:** New habits forming

## Using Forces in Interviews

### During Interview: Track All Four

For each timeline stage, capture all four forces explicitly. Even if one seems absent, note it ("no anxiety expressed at this stage").

### After Interview: Identify Tipping Point

Find the moment when balance shifted:
- What changed Push (pain spike)?
- What strengthened Pull (proof moment)?
- What reduced Anxiety (approval, pilot)?
- What weakened Habit (time wall, peer pressure)?

### In Analysis: Design Interventions

Each force suggests different intervention:

**To amplify Push:**
- Make pain visible (metrics, examples)
- Connect pain to business impact
- Surface hidden costs of status quo

**To strengthen Pull:**
- Show concrete proof (demos, case studies)
- Provide peer testimonials
- Demonstrate specific capabilities

**To reduce Anxiety:**
- Offer pilot/trial periods
- Provide rollback plans
- Share security/TD pre-approvals
- Show similar context success

**To overcome Habit:**
- Create time walls (deprecation, policy)
- Build peer momentum (team adoption)
- Provide migration paths
- Make old way harder (remove support)

## Four Forces Anti-Patterns

### Don't Oversimplify

**Wrong:** "They switched because the new tool was better"
**Right:** "Push (versioning pain) spiked during turnover, Pull (saw peer demo) became concrete, Anxiety (TD pre-integration) was reduced, Habit (migration scripts) was overcome by deadline"

### Don't Skip Forces

**Wrong:** "High Push and Pull, so they switched"
**Right:** "High Push and Pull, but Anxiety about show impact blocked adoption until security approval and pilot success"

### Don't Assume Forces

**Wrong:** "They must have been frustrated with the old way"
**Right:** "When did the current way become unacceptable? Walk me through what happened."

### Don't Neglect Timing

**Wrong:** "Push has been there for years"
**Right:** "Pain existed for years but spiked during turnover freeze, creating decision urgency"

## Outputs for ODI Bridge

After extracting forces, translate to outcomes:
