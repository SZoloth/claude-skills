# Self-Enquiry Method

## What is Self-Enquiry?

Self-enquiry is the practice of questioning your assumptions, beliefs, and habitual responses with curiosity rather than judgment.

**Core principle:** Your automatic interpretations might be incomplete or inaccurate.

## The Five Steps

### 1. Notice

**Practice:** Become aware of your automatic response or belief.

**Examples:**
- "I feel hurt when Carter doesn't respond to my text immediately"
- "I believe I should always have a solution ready"
- "I think showing vulnerability is weak"

**Questions:**
- What am I thinking right now?
- What emotion am I experiencing?
- What's my automatic interpretation?

### 2. Question

**Practice:** Challenge the assumption with genuine curiosity.

**Core questions:**
- "What might I not be seeing?"
- "What assumptions am I making?"
- "How might I be wrong about this?"
- "What evidence contradicts my belief?"

**Examples:**
- "What if Carter was focused on something else?"
- "What if not having an answer is perfectly okay?"
- "What if vulnerability actually strengthens relationships?"

### 3. Consider

**Practice:** Explore alternative perspectives with openness.

**Prompts:**
- "How might someone else see this situation?"
- "What would a trusted friend say?"
- "If my interpretation is wrong, what else could be true?"

**Examples:**
- "Maybe Carter's lack of response isn't about me"
- "Perhaps showing uncertainty demonstrates authenticity"
- "It's possible that vulnerability invites connection"

### 4. Experiment

**Practice:** Try new responses based on alternative perspectives.

**Examples:**
- Share your feelings directly instead of withdrawing
- Say "I don't know" instead of forcing a solution
- Ask for help instead of handling everything alone

**Framework:**
- Start small (low-stakes situations)
- Notice your discomfort (it's information, not danger)
- Observe what happens without judgment

### 5. Observe

**Practice:** Notice the outcome of your experiment without interpreting it as "success" or "failure."

**Questions:**
- What happened?
- How did others respond?
- What did I learn?
- What surprised me?

**Avoid:**
- Jumping to conclusions
- Using one instance to confirm existing beliefs
- Interpreting outcomes as proof you were "right" or "wrong"

## Edge Questions

**Definition:** Questions that push against your comfortable habitual patterns.

**Purpose:** Create growth opportunities by challenging overcontrol.

**Examples:**

**For low self-disclosure:**
- "What would happen if I shared my authentic feelings?"
- "How might vulnerability strengthen this relationship?"
- "What if others actually want to know the real me?"

**For perfectionism:**
- "What if 'good enough' creates more connection than 'perfect'?"
- "Could showing imperfection make me more relatable?"
- "What am I protecting by maintaining high standards?"

**For emotional inhibition:**
- "What would happen if I expressed this emotion?"
- "How might showing my feelings improve the relationship?"
- "What if emotions are information, not danger?"

**For withdrawal:**
- "What if I stayed engaged even though I feel hurt?"
- "How might expressing impact directly serve me?"
- "What am I losing by retreating?"

## Integration with RO-DBT

Self-enquiry supports:
- **Openness:** Questioning assumptions creates space for new information
- **Flexibility:** Considering alternatives enables new responses
- **Connection:** Understanding others' perspectives builds empathy

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Using self-enquiry to self-criticize

**Pitfall:** "I'm so stupid for thinking that way"
**Instead:** "I notice I had that thought - I wonder what else might be true?"

### 2. Seeking the "right" answer

**Pitfall:** "Which perspective is correct?"
**Instead:** "What can I learn from considering multiple perspectives?"

### 3. Over-analyzing

**Pitfall:** Getting lost in endless questioning
**Instead:** Ask 1-2 key questions, then experiment with new responses

### 4. Avoiding action

**Pitfall:** Thinking about change without practicing new behaviors
**Instead:** Small experiments > perfect understanding

## Practice Guidelines

**Daily:** Notice one automatic belief and question it

**Weekly:** Identify one edge question to explore

**Monthly:** Review what you've learned from experiments

**Remember:** The goal isn't to eliminate automatic thoughts, but to hold them lightly and remain curious about alternatives.
