# Common Overcontrol Patterns & Interventions

## Pattern 1: Withdrawal When Hurt

### Manifestation
- Retreating emotionally or physically when feeling unappreciated, criticized, or misunderstood
- Going silent rather than expressing impact
- Creating distance to protect against vulnerability
- Ruminating alone instead of reaching out

### Underlying belief
"If I show I'm hurt, I'll appear weak or needy"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What am I protecting by withdrawing?"
- "What might I gain by sharing the hurt directly?"
- "How is withdrawal affecting my relationships?"

**Edge question:**
- "What would happen if I shared the hurt instead of retreating?"

**Skill practice:**
- Self-disclosure: "When you did X, I felt Y"
- Stating impact using "I" statements
- Staying engaged even when uncomfortable

## Pattern 2: Perfectionism in Relationships

### Manifestation
- High standards for self and others
- Difficulty accepting imperfection
- Tendency to correct or improve
- Frustration when things aren't "right"

### Underlying belief
"If I accept imperfection, standards will collapse"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What might I gain by accepting imperfection?"
- "How does my perfectionism affect my relationships?"
- "What am I afraid will happen if I lower standards?"

**Edge question:**
- "Could 'good enough' create more connection than 'perfect'?"

**Skill practice:**
- Flexible mind: Embracing "both/and" vs "either/or"
- Appreciating effort over outcome
- Celebrating imperfect moments

## Pattern 3: Strategic Avoidance

### Manifestation
- Doing important work in other domains while avoiding emotionally challenging tasks
- Creating elaborate systems instead of taking action
- Optimization and planning as avoidance of execution
- Focus on what's controllable to avoid what's uncertain

### Underlying belief
"If I just get this system perfect, I won't have to face the scary thing"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What emotion am I avoiding by focusing elsewhere?"
- "What would happen if I did the thing I'm avoiding?"
- "How is this pattern serving me (and how is it limiting me)?"

**Edge question:**
- "What if the discomfort is information, not danger?"

**Skill practice:**
- Willingness: Moving toward discomfort with awareness
- Opposite action: Doing what the emotion says not to do
- Small brave steps

## Pattern 4: Low Self-Disclosure

### Manifestation
- Keeping feelings private
- Minimizing vulnerability
- Presenting a curated, controlled self
- Sharing only "acceptable" parts of experience

### Underlying belief
"If others saw my authentic struggle, they'd judge or reject me"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What might happen if others saw my authentic struggle?"
- "Who would I trust with vulnerability?"
- "What am I missing by keeping things private?"

**Edge question:**
- "Could vulnerability deepen trust rather than damage it?"

**Skill practice:**
- Appropriate self-disclosure: Sharing inner experience selectively
- Vulnerability with safe people
- Asking for support

## Pattern 5: Detail-Focused Processing

### Manifestation
- Getting lost in details and missing the big picture
- Over-planning and over-preparing
- Analysis paralysis
- Difficulty making decisions without complete information

### Underlying belief
"If I just understand all the details, I'll make the perfect choice"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What big picture am I missing while focused on details?"
- "What am I trying to control by gathering more information?"
- "When is 'good enough' information actually enough?"

**Edge question:**
- "What if acting with incomplete information is better than perfect planning?"

**Skill practice:**
- Big picture thinking: Zooming out to see patterns
- Time-boxed decisions: Decide by X time regardless
- Trust intuition alongside analysis

## Pattern 6: Compulsive Envy

### Manifestation
- Difficulty experiencing genuine joy for others' success
- Automatic comparison when hearing good news
- Feeling diminished by others' happiness
- Interpreting others' wins as your loss

### Underlying belief
"If others are succeeding, that means I'm failing"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What would it feel like to celebrate others without comparison?"
- "How does my envy affect my relationships?"
- "What if their success doesn't diminish my worth?"

**Edge question:**
- "Could celebrating others' wins actually increase my own joy?"

**Skill practice:**
- Loving kindness (genuinely wishing others well)
- Gratitude practice (noticing abundance vs scarcity)
- Celebration (actively expressing joy for others)

## Pattern 7: Emotional Inhibition

### Manifestation
- Difficulty identifying emotions as they arise
- Keeping feelings controlled and contained
- Fear that expressing emotion will be overwhelming
- Presenting a calm, composed exterior regardless of internal state

### Underlying belief
"If I let emotions out, they'll overwhelm me or damage relationships"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What emotions am I experiencing right now?"
- "What would happen if I named this feeling?"
- "How does suppressing emotions affect my body and relationships?"

**Edge question:**
- "What if expressing emotions in small doses prevents larger eruptions?"

**Skill practice:**
- Emotion labeling: Name feelings as they arise
- Somatic awareness: Notice emotions in the body
- Gradual expression: Share feelings in low-stakes situations

## Pattern 8: Rigid Thinking

### Manifestation
- All-or-nothing thinking
- Difficulty tolerating ambiguity
- Strong "should" rules
- Interpreting exceptions as threats to order

### Underlying belief
"If rules aren't consistent, everything will fall apart"

### RO-DBT intervention

**Self-enquiry:**
- "What might I gain from more flexibility?"
- "Where is my rigid thinking causing suffering?"
- "What if exceptions don't threaten the rule?"

**Edge question:**
- "Could embracing paradox make life richer?"

**Skill practice:**
- Dialectical thinking: Holding opposites simultaneously
- "Both/and" language instead of "either/or"
- Experimenting with breaking minor rules

## Integration Framework

**For each pattern:**
1. **Recognition:** Notice the pattern without judgment
2. **Self-enquiry:** Question the underlying assumption
3. **Edge question:** Generate personalized growth opportunity
4. **Practice:** Experiment with new response
5. **Observation:** Notice outcomes without interpretation
6. **Tracking:** Log to rodbt-progress.json

**Remember:** Patterns developed as adaptive responses. The goal isn't to eliminate them, but to make them flexible rather than rigid.
