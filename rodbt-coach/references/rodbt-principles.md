# RO-DBT Core Principles

## Overview

Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) is designed for individuals with overcontrol - the opposite of the undercontrol that traditional DBT addresses.

## The Overcontrol Spectrum

**Overcontrol:** Excessive self-control that inhibits flexible responding, genuine emotional expression, and authentic connection.

**Five core features:**

1. **Inhibited emotional expression**
   - Difficulty showing feelings
   - Fear that emotions will be overwhelming
   - Tendency to "keep it together" at all costs

2. **Low self-disclosure**
   - Keeping thoughts/feelings private
   - Difficulty being vulnerable
   - Presenting a curated, controlled self

3. **Rigid and rule-governed behavior**
   - Black-and-white thinking
   - Perfectionism and high standards
   - Difficulty with uncertainty or ambiguity

4. **Hyper-detailed/cautious processing**
   - Getting lost in details
   - Over-planning and over-preparing
   - Missing the big picture

5. **Delayed reward**
   - Difficulty experiencing joy in the moment
   - Always working toward future goals
   - Postponing pleasure until "everything is perfect"

## Three Core Skills

### 1. Openness

**Definition:** Willingness to be influenced by new information, even when it contradicts existing beliefs.

**Practice:**
- Notice when you're defending a position
- Ask "What might I not be seeing?"
- Consider alternative explanations with genuine curiosity
- Acknowledge when you might be wrong

### 2. Flexibility

**Definition:** Adapting behavior based on feedback from the environment and social context.

**Practice:**
- Notice habitual responses
- Experiment with new behaviors
- Adjust based on what works (not what "should" work)
- Embrace "both/and" rather than "either/or"

### 3. Social Connectedness

**Definition:** Participating fully in relationships with awareness of impact on others.

**Practice:**
- Self-disclosure (sharing inner experience appropriately)
- Vulnerable communication (expressing needs and feelings)
- Playfulness and spontaneity
- Cooperative awareness (noticing impact on others)

## Social Signaling & Tribe Matters

**Key insight:** Overcontrol often develops in tribes that value:
- **Restraint** over expressiveness
- **Fairness/justice** over forgiveness  
- **Individual achievement** over communal support
- **Protocol adherence** over flexible responding

**Therapeutic implication:** Recognize when childhood tribal values no longer serve adult relationships.

## The Three Cs of Overcontrol

1. **Coping by Correction**
   - Excessive focus on fixing, improving, preventing
   - Difficulty accepting "good enough"
   - Tendency to critique rather than appreciate

2. **Comparison as Status**
   - Defining self-worth through comparison
   - Feeling threatened by others' success
   - Difficulty celebrating others' wins

3. **Compulsive Envy**
   - Difficulty experiencing genuine joy for others
   - Automatic comparison when hearing good news
   - Feeling diminished by others' happiness

## Radical Openness

**Core question:** "What don't I know?"

**Practice:**
- Question your assumptions
- Acknowledge you might be wrong
- Invite feedback (even when uncomfortable)
- Learn from experiences that contradict beliefs

## Integration with Daily Life

RO-DBT isn't about becoming emotionally expressive or abandoning standards. It's about:
- **Flexibility:** Choosing when to be restrained vs. open
- **Authenticity:** Being genuine rather than curated
- **Connection:** Prioritizing relationship over being right
- **Joy:** Experiencing pleasure in the present moment

## Application Areas

- **Relationships:** Practice vulnerability and self-disclosure
- **Work:** Balance achievement with connection
- **Conflict:** Lead with curiosity rather than correction
- **Emotions:** Notice and name feelings as they arise
- **Standards:** Embrace "good enough" when appropriate
