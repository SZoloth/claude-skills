# Systems Thinking Analysis Worksheet

**Problem:** [What recurring problem are we analyzing?]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Analyst:** [Your name]

---

## Step 1: Describe the Problem Behavior

**Observable pattern:**
[What keeps happening? Describe symptoms without diagnosis]

**Frequency:** [How often does this occur?]

**Impact:** [Who/what is affected?]

**Previous attempts to fix:** [What have we tried? What happened?]

---

## Step 2: Identify Key Variables

What elements change over time in this system?

1. [Variable] - [Current trend: increasing/decreasing/stable]
2. [Variable] - [Trend]
3. [Variable] - [Trend]
4. [Variable] - [Trend]
5. [Variable] - [Trend]

---

## Step 3: Map Causal Connections

How do variables affect each other?

| From Variable | To Variable | Relationship | Delay | Strength |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| [A] | [B] | A ↑ → B ↑ | [timing] | [strong/med/weak] |
| [B] | [C] | B ↑ → C ↓ | [timing] | [strong/med/weak] |
| [C] | [D] | C ↓ → D ↑ | [timing] | [strong/med/weak] |

## Step 4: Identify Feedback Loops

### Reinforcing Loops (Amplification)

**Loop R1:** [Name]
- **Path:** [A → B → C → A]
- **Effect:** [What gets amplified?]
- **Current state:** [Virtuous or vicious cycle?]

**Loop R2:** [Name]
- **Path:** [...]
- **Effect:** [...]

### Balancing Loops (Stabilization)

**Loop B1:** [Name]
- **Path:** [A → B → A]
- **Effect:** [What is being stabilized/resisted?]
- **Goal:** [What is system trying to achieve?]

**Loop B2:** [Name]
- **Path:** [...]
- **Effect:** [...]

---

## Step 5: Identify Delays

Where are the time lags between cause and effect?

| Delay | Length | Effect on System |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| [Action A] → [Consequence B] | [3 months] | [Causes overshoot/oscillation/etc.] |
| [Action C] → [Consequence D] | [2 weeks] | [Effect...] |

---

## Step 6: Diagnose System Structure

### What archetype(s) does this match?

- [ ] Fixes That Fail
- [ ] Shifting the Burden
- [ ] Tragedy of the Commons
- [ ] Drift to Low Performance
- [ ] Success to the Successful
- [ ] Limits to Growth
- [ ] Escalation
- [ ] Accidental Adversaries

**Explanation:** [How does this pattern fit?]

### Dominant dynamics

**Current driver:** [Which loop is controlling behavior right now?]

**Limiting factor:** [What constraint is preventing system from improving?]

**Hidden assumptions:** [What beliefs keep system stuck?]

---

## Step 7: Identify Leverage Points

Using Donella Meadows' hierarchy, what intervention points exist?

| Leverage Point | Current State | Proposed Intervention | Expected Impact |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **12. Parameters** | [Numbers we tweak] | [Proposed change] | [Low impact] |
| **9. Delays** | [Time lags] | [How to reduce] | [Medium impact] |
| **6. Information flows** | [Who knows what] | [Make X visible to Y] | [High impact] |
| **5. Rules** | [Current incentives] | [New rules] | [High impact] |
| **3. Goals** | [What system optimizes] | [New goal] | [Very high impact] |

---

## Step 8: Design Intervention

### Recommended intervention

**Target leverage point:** [Which one from above]

**Specific action:** [Exactly what to change]

**Why this should work:**
- Addresses [which loop/delay/structure]
- Changes [what behavior]
- Produces [desired outcome]

### Expected consequences

**Intended effects:**
1. [Positive outcome 1]
2. [Positive outcome 2]

**Potential unintended effects:**
1. [Risk 1] - [Mitigation]
2. [Risk 2] - [Mitigation]

### Success metrics

**Leading indicators** (changes quickly):
- [Metric 1] - [Target change]
- [Metric 2] - [Target change]

**Lagging indicators** (changes slowly):
- [Metric 3] - [Target outcome]

### Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** [Initial actions]
- **Month 1:** [Early signals to watch]
- **Month 3:** [Expected improvements visible]
- **Month 6:** [Full impact assessment]

---

## Step 9: Test and Learn

### Assumptions to validate

1. **Assumption:** [What we believe is true]
   - **Test:** [How to check]
   - **If wrong:** [What we'll do instead]

2. **Assumption:** [...]
   - **Test:** [...]
   - **If wrong:** [...]

### Review schedule

- **Weekly:** [What to monitor]
- **Monthly:** [What to assess]
- **Quarterly:** [Full system review]
