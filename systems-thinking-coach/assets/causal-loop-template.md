## Key Variables

List the main elements that change over time in this system:

1. **[Variable 1]** - [What it measures]
2. **[Variable 2]** - [What it measures]
3. **[Variable 3]** - [What it measures]
4. **[Variable 4]** - [What it measures]
5. **[Variable 5]** - [What it measures]

---

## Causal Relationships

Map how variables affect each other:

### Connection 1
- **From:** [Variable A]
- **To:** [Variable B]
- **Relationship:** [When A increases, B increases/decreases]
- **Delay:** [Immediate | Short (days) | Medium (weeks) | Long (months)]
- **Strength:** [Weak | Moderate | Strong]

### Connection 2
- **From:** [Variable C]
- **To:** [Variable D]
- **Relationship:** [When C increases, D increases/decreases]
- **Delay:** [Timing]
- **Strength:** [Impact level]

## Feedback Loops Identified

### Loop 1: [Loop Name] (Reinforcing/Balancing)

**Type:** [Reinforcing (R) amplifies change | Balancing (B) resists change]

**Path:**
1. [Variable A] increases
2. → [Variable B] increases (because...)
3. → [Variable C] decreases (because...)
4. → [Variable A] increases further (closes loop)

**Effect:** [Virtuous/Vicious cycle that produces...]

**Delays:** [Where are the time lags in this loop?]

---

### Loop 2: [Loop Name] (Reinforcing/Balancing)

**Type:** [R or B]

**Path:**
[Trace the loop...]

**Effect:** [What behavior does this loop produce?]

**Delays:** [Time lags?]

## Diagram (Text Representation)

```
Variable A (+) → Variable B
     ↑              ↓ (-)
     |          Variable C
     |              ↓ (+)
     +----------Variable D

R: Reinforcing Loop 1 (A → B → C → D → A)
```

**Legend:**
- (+) = Same direction (A increases → B increases)
- (-) = Opposite direction (B increases → C decreases)
- R = Reinforcing loop (amplifies)
- B = Balancing loop (stabilizes)

## Analysis

### Dominant loop
[Which loop is currently driving system behavior?]

### Problem mechanism
[How does this system structure produce the problematic behavior we observe?]

### Delays and their effects
[Where do delays cause oscillation, overshoot, or prevent learning?]

### Leverage Point 1: [Description]
- **Type:** [Information flow | Rules | Goals | etc.]
- **Action:** [What to change]
- **Expected effect:** [How system behavior should shift]
- **Risks:** [Potential unintended consequences]

### Leverage Point 2: [Description]
[Same structure...]
