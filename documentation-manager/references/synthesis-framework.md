# Research Synthesis Framework

## Purpose

Transform scattered research findings into cohesive insights that inform decision-making. This framework ensures systematic analysis while maintaining evidence integrity.

## Five-Step Synthesis Process

### 1. Gather sources
- Identify all relevant research documents (interviews, meeting notes, observations)
- Note time range and stakeholder coverage
- Check for gaps in representation (missing departments, roles, perspectives)

### 2. Extract findings
- Pull direct quotes with file citations (filename:line)
- Note contradictions or tensions between sources
- Identify recurring themes across multiple conversations
- Tag by department, role, or topic area

### 3. Pattern recognition
- Group related findings into clusters
- Name patterns clearly and descriptively
- Note frequency (how many sources mention this)
- Distinguish strong signals from weak ones

### 4. Connect to outcomes
- Link patterns to business goals or user needs
- Identify implications for product decisions
- Note dependencies or prerequisites
- Surface questions that need validation

### 5. Document synthesis
- Use template from `assets/synthesis-template.md`
- Separate "Verified Research" from "Analysis/Interpretation"
- Include all source citations
- Provide clear recommendations or next steps

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing synthesis:
- [ ] All quotes have file citations
- [ ] Patterns supported by multiple sources (not single data points)
- [ ] Contradictions or tensions acknowledged, not hidden
- [ ] Clear distinction between fact and interpretation
- [ ] Recommendations traceable to evidence
- [ ] Missing stakeholder perspectives noted explicitly

## Common Pitfalls

**Avoid:**
- Cherry-picking quotes that support predetermined conclusions
- Conflating single anecdotes with patterns
- Hiding contradictory evidence
- Making recommendations without clear evidence trails
- Using stakeholder quotes out of context

**Instead:**
- Present full range of perspectives
- Quantify pattern strength (3 of 5 stakeholders mentioned...)
- Surface tensions directly (Story wants X, but Layout needs Y...)
- Show the evidence chain: quote → pattern → implication → recommendation
- Preserve nuance and context from original conversations
