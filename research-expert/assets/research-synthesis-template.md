# Research Synthesis: [Topic]

**Date range:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD
**Participants:** [N] interviews with [roles/departments]
**Researcher:** [Your name]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: What did we learn? What should we do about it?]

---

## Research Context

**Goal:** [What we were trying to understand]

**Methods:** [Interviews, observations, usability tests, etc.]

**Participants:**
- [Role 1]: N participants
- [Role 2]: N participants
- [Role 3]: N participants

**Time period:** [When research conducted]

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: [Clear, specific finding]

**Evidence:**
> "Quote from participant"
> — Participant Name, Role (transcript.md:line)

> "Supporting quote"
> — Participant Name, Role (transcript.md:line)

**Frequency:** [X of Y participants mentioned this]

**Impact:** [How this affects users daily work/outcomes]

**Implication:** [What this means for product decisions]

---

### Finding 2: [Another finding]

**Evidence:**
[Quotes with citations]

**Frequency:** [How widespread]

**Impact:** [User/business impact]

**Implication:** [Product implication]

---

### Finding 3: [Another finding]

[Same structure...]

---

## Opportunities Identified

### High-Priority Opportunities

#### Opportunity 1: [Opportunity framing]

**User need:** [What users are trying to accomplish]

**Supporting evidence:**
- [Finding 1 from above]
- [Finding 2 from above]
- [Quote] (source:line)

**Frequency:** [X of Y participants]

**Impact potential:** [High/Medium/Low based on evidence]

**Next steps:** [Validation experiments recommended]

---

#### Opportunity 2: [Opportunity framing]

[Same structure...]

---

### Medium-Priority Opportunities

[Opportunities with less evidence or lower impact]

---

## What's Working Well

**Preserve these aspects:**
- [Thing 1 that users love]
  - Evidence: [Quote] (source:line)
- [Thing 2 that works well]
  - Evidence: [Quote] (source:line)

**Why this matters:** Don't "fix" what users already value.

---

## Patterns and Themes

### Theme 1: [Cross-cutting pattern]

**Observations:**
- [Pattern observed across multiple participants]
- [How this manifests in different contexts]

**Affected user segments:** [Who experiences this]

---

### Theme 2: [Another pattern]

[Same structure...]
