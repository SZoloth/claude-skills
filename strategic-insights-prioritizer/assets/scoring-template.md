# Opportunity Scoring: [Opportunity Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scored by:** [Your name, Team]
**Decision timeline:** [When decision needs to be made]

---

## Opportunity Summary

**Problem statement:** [What user problem does this address]

**Proposed approach:** [High-level solution direction]

**Evidence source:** [Research, stakeholder input, competitive analysis]

---

## Scoring Dimensions

### Value Factors (Positive)

#### Business Impact (+0 to +3)

**Score: [X]/3**

Considerations:
- Revenue potential (new customers, upsell, retention)
- Cost reduction (operational efficiency, support burden)
- Strategic positioning (competitive differentiation, market expansion)

**Rationale:** [Why this score]

**Evidence:** [Data or research supporting this assessment]

---

#### User Impact (+0 to +3)

**Score: [X]/3**

Considerations:
- Problem severity (how painful is current state?)
- User coverage (how many affected?)
- Frequency (how often does pain occur?)

**Rationale:** [Why this score]

**Evidence:** [User research quotes, usage data]

---

#### Confidence (+0 to +2)

**Score: [X]/2**

Considerations:
- Evidence strength (validated with users vs assumption)
- Clarity of requirements (well-defined vs fuzzy)
- Precedent (done before vs novel)

**Rationale:** [Why this score]

**Evidence:** [What gives us confidence or uncertainty]

---

#### Leverage (+0 to +2)

**Score: [X]/2**

Considerations:
- Platform value (benefits multiple use cases)
- Reusability (applicable across departments/products)
- Network effects (value increases with adoption)

**Rationale:** [Why this score]

**Evidence:** [Where else this could apply]

---

### Risk Factors (Negative)

#### Effort (-0 to -3)

**Score: [-X]/3**

Considerations:
- Development time (weeks/months)
- Team size required
- Technical complexity

**Rationale:** [Why this score]

**Estimate:** [Engineering estimate if available]

---

#### Risk (-0 to -2)

**Score: [-X]/2**

Considerations:
- Technical feasibility (proven vs experimental)
- Dependency complexity (standalone vs tightly coupled)
- Reversibility (easy to back out vs permanent)

**Rationale:** [Why this score]

**Mitigation:** [How we'd reduce risk]

---

#### Adoption Friction (-0 to -2)

**Score: [-X]/2**

Considerations:
- Change magnitude (minor vs workflow overhaul)
- Training required
- Stakeholder buy-in difficulty

**Rationale:** [Why this score]

**Change management plan:** [How we'd drive adoption]

---

## Total Score

```
Priority Score = (Business + User + Confidence + Leverage) - (Effort + Risk + Adoption)

Business Impact:    +[X]
User Impact:        +[X]
Confidence:         +[X]
Leverage:           +[X]
                    ----
Subtotal (Value):   +[X]

Effort:             -[X]
Risk:               -[X]
Adoption Friction:  -[X]
                    ----
Subtotal (Risk):    -[X]

TOTAL SCORE:        [+/-X]
```

**Interpretation:**
- **+6 to +10:** Clear priority - high value, manageable risk
- **+3 to +5:** Strong candidate - evaluate capacity
- **0 to +2:** Marginal - likely defer unless strategic
- **Negative:** Avoid or redesign to improve fundamentals

---

## Assumptions and Uncertainties

### Critical assumptions:
1. **[Assumption]**
   - If wrong: [Impact on score]
   - How to validate: [Test method]

2. **[Assumption]**
   - If wrong: [Impact]
   - Validation: [Method]

### What could change this score:
- [Factor 1 that would increase priority]
- [Factor 2 that would decrease priority]
- [New information that would shift assessment]
