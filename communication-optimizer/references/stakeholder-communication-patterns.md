# Stakeholder Communication Patterns

## Adapting Style by Audience

Different stakeholders need different communication approaches based on their role, priorities, and decision-making style.

## Executive/C-Suite

**What they care about:**
- Business outcomes and ROI
- Strategic alignment
- Risk and opportunity
- Resource allocation

**Communication style:**
- BLUF always - lead with recommendation
- One page or less
- Visual when possible (charts, tables)
- Actionable asks, clear decisions needed

**Structure:**
```markdown
**Decision needed:** [What and by when]
**Recommendation:** [Your proposal in 1 sentence]
**Why:** [3 bullets max]
**Risk if we don't:** [Business impact]
**Investment required:** [Time/money/people]
```

**Avoid:**
- Long narratives
- Technical details
- Process descriptions
- Ambiguous recommendations

## Engineering Leadership

**What they care about:**
- Technical feasibility
- Architecture implications
- Technical debt tradeoffs
- Team capacity and skill fit

**Communication style:**
- Lead with technical approach
- Show you've thought through edge cases
- Acknowledge technical challenges
- Respect their expertise

**Structure:**
```markdown
**Proposed approach:** [Technical solution]
**Alternatives considered:** [What else we looked at]
**Technical risks:** [What could go wrong]
**Dependencies:** [What we need from them]
**Effort estimate:** [Best understanding of scope]
```

**Avoid:**
- Oversimplifying technical complexity
- Ignoring technical debt concerns
- Dismissing their constraints
- Presenting as trivial

## Design Leadership

**What they care about:**
- User experience quality
- Design system consistency
- Interaction patterns
- Accessibility and inclusion

**Communication style:**
- Show user research evidence
- Reference design principles
- Acknowledge design tradeoffs
- Respect their craft

**Structure:**
```markdown
**User need:** [Problem we're solving]
**Design approach:** [Interaction model]
**Research evidence:** [What users told us]
**Design tradeoffs:** [Simplicity vs power, etc.]
**Design system impact:** [New patterns needed?]
```

**Avoid:**
- Spec'ing UI without design input
- "Just make it pretty" attitude
- Ignoring accessibility
- Treating design as decoration

## Product Management Peers

**What they care about:**
- Strategic fit and prioritization
- Cross-product dependencies
- Resource contention
- Shared learnings

**Communication style:**
- Collaborative, not competitive
- Share discoveries openly
- Acknowledge dependencies
- Offer to help

**Structure:**
```markdown
**What we're learning:** [Research insights]
**Potential dependencies:** [Where we might intersect]
**Questions for you:** [What we need to understand]
**How we can help:** [Resources we can share]
```

**Avoid:**
- Territorial behavior
- Hoarding information
- Surprise announcements
- Competing for same resources without alignment

## Sales/Customer Success

**What they care about:**
- Customer impact and feedback
- Competitive positioning
- Feature availability timeline
- Messaging and positioning

**Communication style:**
- Customer-centric framing
- Clear on timing (don't overpromise)
- Provide talking points
- Enable them to represent product

**Structure:**
```markdown
**What's shipping:** [Feature in customer terms]
**Customer benefit:** [Value they'll see]
**Timeline:** [When available, to whom]
**How to message:** [Key points for customer conversations]
**Competitive angle:** [How this compares]
```

**Avoid:**
- Technical jargon
- Vague timelines
- Promising features not committed
- Changing messaging frequently

## Finance/Operations

**What they care about:**
- Budget impact and ROI
- Process efficiency
- Risk management
- Metrics and measurement

**Communication style:**
- Quantify everything possible
- Show cost-benefit analysis
- Acknowledge operational impact
- Respect their need for predictability

**Structure:**
```markdown
**Investment required:** [Cost in $ and people]
**Expected return:** [Revenue/savings/efficiency]
**Payback period:** [When we break even]
**Operational impact:** [Process changes needed]
**Success metrics:** [How we'll measure]
```

**Avoid:**
- Vague estimates
- Ignoring operational complexity
- Assuming unlimited budget
- Handwaving on ROI

## Adapting to Decision-Making Styles

### Data-driven decision makers
- Lead with numbers and evidence
- Show analysis methodology
- Provide confidence intervals
- Compare options quantitatively

### Intuition-driven decision makers
- Tell compelling story
- Use analogies and examples
- Show vision and possibility
- Allow time to "feel" right

### Consensus seekers
- Show broad stakeholder input
- Demonstrate alignment efforts
- Provide multiple perspectives
- Build coalition before asking for decision

### Fast decision makers
- Get to the point immediately
- Provide clear options
- Don't over-analyze
- Be ready to act quickly

## Meeting Format Considerations

### Pre-read culture
- Send materials 24-48 hours advance
- Keep to 1-2 pages
- Make skimmable (headers, bullets)
- Meeting focuses on questions/decisions

### Presentation culture
- Prepare slides (but keep minimal)
- Tell story, don't read slides
- Engage with questions throughout
- End with clear next steps

### Discussion culture
- Bring questions to explore
- Facilitate conversation
- Capture decisions and owners
- Follow up with written summary

## Timing Strategies

### Early socialization
Plant seeds weeks before decision needed. Get informal feedback, address concerns, build support.

### Staged alignment
Don't surprise large groups. Build one-on-one support first, then bring to broader forum.

### Know when to push
- Deadline approaching
- Cost of delay clear
- Stakeholders aligned
- Decision owner engaged

### Know when to wait
- Major concerns unaddressed
- Key stakeholder absent
- Better data coming soon
- Too many competing priorities
