# Minto Pyramid Principle - Detailed Guide

## Core Concept

**Start with the answer, then support it.** Readers comprehend information faster when you present the conclusion first, then the reasoning that supports it.

## Three Rules

### Rule 1: Ideas at any level summarize ideas below

Each summary statement must encapsulate all grouped ideas beneath it.

**Example:**
- **Summary:** We should prioritize collections management
  - **Supporting idea 1:** Artists lose 30% of time searching
  - **Supporting idea 2:** Current structure fails at scale
  - **Supporting idea 3:** Cross-team duplication is rampant

### Rule 2: Ideas in each grouping must be same kind

Don't mix categories within a group.

**Wrong (mixed):**
- Artists need better search (capability)
- Implementation will take 8 weeks (timeline)
- Charles Adams approved the approach (decision)

**Right (same kind - all problems):**
- Artists can't find assets quickly
- Version confusion causes rework
- Teams duplicate reference gathering

### Rule 3: Ideas must be logically ordered

**Common orderings:**
- **Chronological:** First this happened, then that
- **Structural:** By department, geography, component
- **Comparative:** Most to least important, easiest to hardest
- **Deductive:** Major premise → Minor premise → Conclusion

## Application Process

### 1. Determine governing thought
What is the single idea that summarizes your entire document?

**Not:** "This document discusses collections management"
**Better:** "Implement collections management to reduce artist search time by 50%"

### 2. Identify key supporting arguments
What 3-5 major reasons support your governing thought? Each should be:
- Mutually exclusive (no overlap)
- Collectively exhaustive (covers all major points)
- Same logical level (all "whys" or all "hows")

### 3. Order arguments
Use one ordering principle for the entire group:
- Deductive (if A and B, then C)
- Time (first, second, third)
- Structure (dept X, dept Y, dept Z)
- Comparative (most important to least)

### 4. Support each argument
Each key argument needs its own 3-5 supporting ideas, following the same three rules.

## Example Restructure

### Original (narrative order):
We interviewed 12 story artists. They mentioned search problems. Some talked about version confusion. A few mentioned collaboration issues. We also observed their workflows. Based on this, we think collections management would help. It could reduce search time. Artists might collaborate better. Version control would improve.

### Pyramid restructure:
**Governing thought:** Implement collections management to solve Story department's three critical workflow blockers.

**Key argument 1:** Artists lose 30-40% of work time to asset search
- 12 of 12 interviewed cited search as top pain point
- Average 2.5 hours/day spent searching vs creating
- No semantic search capability in current folder system

**Key argument 2:** Version confusion causes duplicate work
- Teams can't identify "latest approved" version
- Rework estimated at 15-20% of production time
- No single source of truth for asset status

**Key argument 3:** Cross-team collaboration is blind
- Teams unaware of relevant work in other productions
- Asset duplication across shows (estimated 40% redundancy)
- No discovery mechanism for related reference material

## When Pyramid Works Best

**Strong fit:**
- Recommendations or proposals
- Research synthesis
- Decision memos
- Executive summaries

**Weaker fit:**
- Chronological narratives
- Procedural instructions
- Exploratory thinking documents

## Common Pitfalls

**Violating rule 1 (summary doesn't match grouped ideas):**
- Summary: "Artists need better tools"
- Supporting ideas: Search takes too long, Version confusion, Training gap

Problem: Training gap isn't a "tool" issue - it's a different category.

**Violating rule 2 (mixing types):**
- Problem statements mixed with solution ideas
- Facts mixed with recommendations
- Current state mixed with future state

**Violating rule 3 (illogical order):**
- Presenting arguments in random sequence
- Jumping between structural levels
- No clear progression of thought
