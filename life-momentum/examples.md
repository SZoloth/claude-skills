## Error Handling Examples

### Missing Dependencies
**Error:** "Cannot find module 'dotenv'"

**Claude Response:**
The momentum analysis tool needs its dependencies installed. Let me fix this:

```bash
cd "/Users/samuelz/Documents/LLM CONTEXT/1 - personal/project_ideas/life-momentum"
npm install
```

Then run the analysis again.

### Incorrect Path Configuration
**Error:** "No domains found"

**Claude Response:**
The tool might not be configured for your documentation structure. Let me check the configuration:

The tool expects your personal docs to be in the LLM CONTEXT root. If your structure is different, we may need to update the domain paths in `lib/domain-config.ts`.

### Scores Don't Match Reality
**User:** "The momentum score doesn't feel right"

**Claude Response:**
Momentum analysis is based on file activity patterns. If the scores don't match your perception:

1. **Check recent activity** - Have you been updating documentation regularly?
2. **Adjust weights** - Maybe some domains are weighted incorrectly for your current priorities
3. **Review activity rules** - The tool might not recognize your work patterns

Let's look at the raw data and calibrate the scoring to better match your reality.
