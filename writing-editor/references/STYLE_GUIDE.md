# Detailed Style Guide Reference

Comprehensive rules for the writing-editor skill. Reference when detailed guidance needed.

## Voice Philosophy

### Core Principle
**Informed optimism with a specificity moat**

The goal is writing that:
- Takes clear positions (Stratechery influence)
- Preserves authentic expression (Every influence)
- Demonstrates research depth (Not Boring influence)

### Voice Calibration

| Dial | Setting | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| Conviction | HIGH | Write with authority; don't hedge unless uncertainty is real |
| Hedging | LOW | Cut qualifiers; be explicit when uncertain |
| Bullishness | MEASURED | Optimistic but acknowledge counter-arguments |
| First-person | STRATEGIC | Don't lead with "I" but use when earned |

## Anti-Beige Rules

### Kill Words (Flag for Removal)

These can almost always be deleted without loss:
- actually
- very
- just
- really
- quite
- somewhat
- basically
- literally (unless literal)
- obviously
- clearly (unless truly clear)

### Hedge Phrases (Challenge Each)

Flag these and require justification:
- "I think..."
- "It seems like..."
- "might potentially..."
- "perhaps..."
- "It could be argued..."
- "Some would say..."

**Rule**: Keep only if uncertainty is genuinely the point. Otherwise, make declarative.

### Corporate Language (Replace)

| Beige | Better |
|-------|--------|
| leverage | use |
| utilize | use |
| paradigm | model, approach |
| synergy | combination, partnership |
| actionable | practical |
| bandwidth | capacity, time |
| circle back | follow up, revisit |
| deep dive | analysis, examination |
| low-hanging fruit | easy wins |
| move the needle | make progress, improve |
| at the end of the day | ultimately |
| going forward | from now on, next |

### Voice Preservation (Protect)

DO preserve:
- Odd phrases that work
- Unexpected metaphors
- Specific observations
- Personal anecdotes
- Authentic weirdness

DON'T smooth away:
- Unusual word choices (if effective)
- Unconventional sentence structure (if clear)
- Strong opinions (if supported)
- Humor (if natural)

## Structural Rules

### Pre-Draft Requirements

Before writing should begin:
- [ ] Thesis expressible in one sentence
- [ ] Causal relationships understood
- [ ] Full argument outlinable without gaps
- [ ] Uncertainty locations identified

If any fail → more research/thinking needed, not more writing.

### Thrust vs Drag

**Thrust** (keep): Content that advances the argument
- Key insights
- Necessary context
- Supporting evidence
- Transition that aids flow

**Drag** (cut): Content that fills space
- Throat-clearing ("As we all know...")
- Redundant setup
- Tangential musing
- Repetition without purpose

**Test**: If removed, would the piece lose anything essential? If no → drag.

### Bear Case Requirement

For any significant bull thesis:
1. Explicitly state what could go wrong
2. Acknowledge strongest counter-argument
3. Explain why you maintain position despite counterpoint
4. Or: reduce conviction if counterpoint is strong

Not required for quick takes or factual pieces.

## Mechanical Rules

### Capitalization

**Title Case** for:
- Article headlines
- Section headers (H1, H2)

**Sentence case** for:
- Bullet points
- Subheadings (H3+)
- Captions
- Button text
- Everything else

### Company/Team References

- **Company**: singular ("Apple released **its** product")
- **Team/Group of people**: plural ("The engineers finished **their** work")

### Voice (Active vs Passive)

**Default**: Active voice

**Acceptable passive when**:
- Agent is unknown or unimportant
- Emphasis required on object
- Style/rhythm requires it

**Transform**:
- "Mistakes were made" → "We made mistakes"
- "The decision was reached" → "The team decided"
- "It was determined that" → "[Subject] determined"

### Numbers

- Spell out: one through nine
- Numerals: 10 and above
- Always numerals for: ages, percentages, measurements
- Spell out if starting a sentence (or rephrase)

### Punctuation

- **Oxford comma**: Yes (x, y, and z)
- **Em dash**: No spaces around (word—word)
- **Ellipsis**: No space before, one space after (word... next)
- **Quotation marks**: American style (periods and commas inside)

### Links

- Keep link text to 2-4 words
- Never "click here"
- Make links descriptive of destination

---

## Content Type Adaptations

### Quick Takes (<500 words)

- Voice-first, structure-light
- Can be more spontaneous
- Light framework requirements
- Preserve weirdness maximally
- Time: 1-2 hours

### Essays (500-2000 words)

- Framework must be complete
- Balance voice and structure
- Clear thesis required
- Medium bear case requirement
- Time: 4-8 hours

### Deep Dives (2000+ words)

- Maximum framework rigor
- Multiple source requirement
- Full bear case consideration
- Measured bullishness
- Time: 12-20+ hours

## Editing Priority

When reviewing, check in this order:

1. **Anti-beige** (HIGH)
   - Any corporate/generic language?
   - Kill words present?
   - Hedge phrases without justification?

2. **Structural completeness** (HIGH)
   - Framework complete?
   - Thesis clear?
   - Bear case present (if needed)?

3. **Voice preservation** (HIGH)
   - Authentic expression intact?
   - Weirdness preserved?
   - Personality present?

4. **Mechanical** (MEDIUM)
   - Capitalization correct?
   - Company/team references?
   - Active voice used?

## Examples

### Beige → Better

**Beige**: "At the end of the day, I actually think this might potentially be a game-changer in terms of leveraging synergies."

**Better**: "This changes the game by combining X and Y in ways no one has."

---

**Beige**: "It seems like there's been some really interesting movement in the space recently."

**Better**: "Three things happened last month that signal a shift: [specific examples]."

---

### Over-hedged → Confident

**Over-hedged**: "I think it could be argued that Apple might be positioning itself to potentially enter the healthcare market."

**Confident**: "Apple is entering healthcare. The evidence: [specifics]."

---

**Over-hedged**: "It seems like this might perhaps be worth considering."

**Confident**: "This matters because [reason]." OR "I'm uncertain whether this matters—here's why: [honest uncertainty]."

---

### Generic → Specific

**Generic**: "Many companies have recently started exploring AI."

**Specific**: "Since GPT-4 launched in March 2023, 73% of Fortune 500 companies have announced AI initiatives—up from 12% the year before."

---

**Generic**: "The startup grew quickly."

**Specific**: "Revenue went from $100K to $2M in eight months."

---

## Read-Aloud Requirement

**Non-negotiable final step before publishing.**

Reading aloud catches:
- Awkward phrasing
- Rhythm problems
- Sentences that don't breathe
- Unintended repetition
- Logic gaps (you'll stumble)

Do this for every piece, regardless of length.
