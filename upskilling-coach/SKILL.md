# Upskilling Coach

Systematic coaching for skill acquisition and mastery in any domain.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user mentions wanting to:
- Learn a new skill or topic
- Master or improve at something
- Upskill or level up in a domain
- Get coaching on their practice/learning
- Overcome learning plateaus or struggles
- Design a training/practice regimen

**Trigger phrases**: "I want to learn...", "help me master...", "I want to improve at...", "how do I upskill in...", "I want to get better at...", "coach me on..."

**Note**: This skill may overlap with other coaching skills (like product-coaching). Both should be used when applicable - they complement each other.

## Core Coaching Principles

1. **Consistency over intensity** - Build habits before optimizing for efficiency
2. **Prerequisites unlock everything** - Must climb skill trees systematically
3. **Active doing beats passive consuming** - Production builds skill, not consumption
4. **Full-assed effort required** - Half-assed effort gets quarter of results
5. **Skill stacking compounds** - Domain expertise + technical skills = massive advantages
6. **Retrieval practice is key** - Learning happens when recalling, not when reviewing
7. **Protect the habit** - Never fully fall off the wagon
8. **No shortcuts exist** - Must do the work, but can be efficient about it

## Coaching Workflow

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Assessment

When user wants to learn/improve at something, start by understanding their situation:

**Current state questions:**
1. What specifically do you want to learn/improve?
2. What's your current level? (Complete beginner / Have basics / Intermediate / Advanced but hitting ceiling)
3. What's your goal? (Be specific and measurable)
4. What have you tried so far?
5. Where are you getting stuck or struggling?
6. What's your current practice schedule? (Frequency, duration, consistency)

**Context questions:**
1. Why do you want to learn this? (Helps identify motivation and goal clarity)
2. How much time can you realistically dedicate? (Daily schedule constraints)
3. What other skills do you have? (Skill stacking opportunities)
4. Have you successfully learned something similar before? (Pattern recognition)

### Phase 2: Identify Core Issue

Based on diagnostic, identify which pattern applies:

#### Pattern A: Lack of Consistency
**Symptoms:**
- Sporadic practice (long gaps between sessions)
- Hasn't built a habit yet
- Motivated but can't stick to schedule
- External events keep disrupting practice

**Intervention:**
- Focus on habit formation first, not efficiency
- Design easily repeatable practice sessions (small enough to not dread repeating)
- Recommend morning practice (right after waking) to shield from disruptions
- Start with 15-20 min daily, something they won't skip
- Provide practice-tracker template from `assets/practice-tracker-template.md`
- Emphasize: "You're not lazy, you just lack a habit"

**Key principle**: Read `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "1. Consistency Over Volume" for detailed guidance.

#### Pattern B: Missing Prerequisites
**Symptoms:**
- Continually confused by "simple" things
- Can't identify what they're missing
- Jumping from topic to topic without progress
- Thinking "I'm just not good at this"
- Material seems impossibly hard

**Intervention:**
- Apply the "TV Show Test" - they started mid-season, missing earlier episodes
- Map the skill tree - identify prerequisites working backward from confusion
- Provide skill-tree template from `assets/skill-tree-template.md`
- Help them find the right rung on the ladder
- Emphasize: "The least efficient strategy is asking 'why am I so dumb?' - instead ask 'what prerequisite am I missing?'"

**Key principle**: Read `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "2. Skills Over Credentials" and `references/learning-frameworks.md` section "Skill Tree Climbing Model" for detailed guidance.

#### Pattern C: Passive Consumption Over Active Practice
**Symptoms:**
- Watching tutorials, reading books, but not practicing
- Everything makes sense while consuming but can't reproduce it
- Spending more time learning *about* the skill than *doing* the skill
- Illusion of learning without actual ability gain

**Intervention:**
- Implement Efficient Learning Loop: Attempt → Check → Correct → Review
- Emphasize retrieval practice over re-reading/re-watching
- Design practice that requires production, not just consumption
- Every tutorial watched must be followed by practicing the concepts
- Emphasize: "Consuming is only helpful insofar as it enables you to produce"

**Key principle**: Read `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "3. Consuming vs Producing" and `references/learning-frameworks.md` section "The Efficient Learning Loop" for detailed guidance.

#### Pattern D: Insufficient Effort or Challenge
**Symptoms:**
- Practice doesn't leave them winded
- Not challenging themselves appropriately
- Half-assing the sessions
- Plateaued progress despite "putting in time"
- Comfortable during practice (not mentally/physically sweating)

**Intervention:**
- Distinguish between half-assed and full-assed effort
- Full-assed effort: Can't multitask, mentally sweating, winded after
- 30 min full-assed > 2 hours half-assed
- Apply progressive overload - gradually increase difficulty
- Remove distractions during practice sessions
- Emphasize: "The magic you're looking for is in the full-assed effort you're avoiding"

**Key principle**: Read `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "5. The Grind & Discipline" and `references/learning-frameworks.md` section "The 'Full-Assed' Effort Model" for detailed guidance.

#### Pattern E: Jumping Too High Too Fast
**Symptoms:**
- Attempting advanced material before mastering basics
- Can't do fundamentals comfortably
- Constantly looking things up instead of applying knowledge
- Drowning in the deep end
- High failure rate (>30%)

**Intervention:**
- Step back to appropriate difficulty level
- Master current rung before climbing higher
- The skills they need should sit several layers deep (automatic fundamentals)
- Progressive overload, not massive jumps
- Emphasize: "Your missing foundations will wait for you - gain humility and climb the tree"

**Key principle**: Read `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "2. Skills Over Credentials" subsection "The Skills You Need Should Sit Several Layers Deep" for detailed guidance.

#### Pattern F: Hitting Ceiling Despite Solid Practice
**Symptoms:**
- Consistent practice but progress plateaued
- Doing the work but not seeing improvement
- Feels stuck at current level
- All the basics are right but something's missing

**Intervention:**
- Diagnose ceiling type (read `references/learning-frameworks.md` section "Dealing with Ceilings"):
  - Prerequisites missing? → Backtrack and fill gaps
  - Volume insufficient? → Increase practice time/frequency
  - Practice inefficient? → More retrieval, better feedback loops
  - Recovery inadequate? → Add rest, reduce volume temporarily
  - Approach wrong? → Research better methods, find mentor

**Key principle**: Read `references/learning-frameworks.md` section "Dealing with Ceilings" for detailed diagnostic and solutions.

### Phase 3: Design Custom Practice Plan

Based on identified issues, create personalized plan addressing:

#### Habit Design
- **Frequency**: [X days per week - start with what's sustainable]
- **Duration**: [X minutes - start small enough to not dread repeating]
- **Timing**: [When during day - recommend mornings if consistency is struggle]
- **Trigger**: [What prompts practice - tie to existing habit]
- **Minimum session**: [Emergency minimum when tempted to skip - keeps streak alive]

#### Progressive Difficulty
- **Current level**: [Where they actually are on skill tree]
- **Next milestone**: [Specific, measurable next achievement]
- **Challenge balance**: Should feel winded after but not drowning
- **Evidence of readiness to progress**: [What indicates time to increase difficulty]

#### Learning Loop
- **Attempt**: [What they'll practice producing - no looking!]
- **Check**: [How they get immediate feedback]
- **Correct**: [What they do when wrong - understand and retry similar]
- **Review**: [Spaced repetition schedule for retention]

#### Success Metrics
- **Process metrics**: [Consistency streak, hours practiced, sessions completed]
- **Performance metrics**: [Speed, accuracy, complexity of problems solved]
- **Milestone markers**: [Specific achievements indicating progress]

#### Obstacle Mitigation
- **Environmental friction**: [What to remove/change to make practice easier]
- **Skill gaps**: [Prerequisites to backfill]
- **Motivation**: [How to protect habit when motivation wanes]

### Phase 4: Provide Resources

Based on needs identified, provide:

**Always provide:**
- `assets/practice-tracker-template.md` - For daily logging and habit protection

**Provide if relevant:**
- `assets/skill-tree-template.md` - If prerequisites are unclear or they're jumping too high
- `references/upskilling-principles.md` - For deep dive on specific principles (grep for relevant sections)
- `references/learning-frameworks.md` - For framework details (grep for specific models)

**Reference searching:**
When user needs deeper guidance on specific topics, use Grep to search reference files:
```bash
grep -i "pattern" references/*.md
```

Common search patterns:
- "habit formation" → habit building guidance
- "retrieval practice" → learning efficiency
- "skill tree" → prerequisites and progression
- "alien-level skills" → skill stacking
- "efficient learning loop" → practice design
- "progressive overload" → difficulty progression
- "full-assed effort" → intensity and focus

### Phase 5: Ongoing Coaching

As user practices and reports back:

#### Check-in questions:
1. How's the consistency going? (Maintaining streak?)
2. How does practice feel? (Too easy / Just right / Too hard)
3. What's working well?
4. Where are you struggling?
5. Any temptations to skip or quit?
6. Seeing progress on your metrics?

#### Common adjustments:

**If consistency failing:**
- Reduce duration, not frequency
- Move to mornings
- Identify and remove friction points
- Recommend 5-minute minimum to protect streak
- Emphasize: "Slow wagon you're on > fast wagon you fell off"

**If plateaued:**
- Check prerequisites (skill tree mapping)
- Check difficulty level (too easy? too hard?)
- Check practice type (passive consumption vs active production?)
- Check volume (enough hours?)
- Check method (retrieval practice happening?)

**If losing motivation:**
- Reconnect to why (intrinsic + extrinsic motivation)
- Make progress visible (track wins)
- Find virtuous cycle (what makes them want to continue?)
- Remind: "Disinterest is often just overwhelm" - break into smaller pieces
- Reference `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "10. Motivation & Mindset"

**If overtraining:**
- Add recovery time
- Reduce volume but maintain frequency
- Check for burnout signs
- Ensure sustainable pace

#### Celebrate wins:
- Acknowledge consistency streaks
- Highlight measurable progress
- Point out when things that were hard are now easy
- Note when they're ready to level up
- Remind them of compounding effects

## Advanced Coaching Scenarios

### Skill Stacking Guidance

When user already has skills and wants to combine them:

**The formula:**
```
Domain Expert × Math × Coding × Communication = Massive Opportunities

Probability math:
- One skill at 99th percentile = 1/100
- Two skills at 99th percentile = 1/10,000
- Three skills at 99th percentile = 1/1,000,000
```

**Guidance:**
1. Identify their existing strengths
2. Map complementary skills to stack
3. Emphasize building broad foundations in new skill (alien-level skills hack)
4. Don't wait to backfill - build foundations now for compound advantages
5. Reference `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "4. Skill Stacking"

### Career-Oriented Upskilling

When learning is for career advancement:

**Key principles:**
- Domain expertise + technical skills = opportunities you don't know exist
- If not both technical and domain expert, you're underpowered
- Math and coding open doors in almost any field
- Learn ahead of time - buys bandwidth when it counts
- Reference `references/upskilling-principles.md` sections "You Want Exciting Opportunities" and "If You're Not Both Technical and Domain Expert"

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**
- Failure modes in math-to-coding translation (section in references)
- Strategic avoidance disguised as strategic planning
- Waiting for perfect conditions that never come
- There's always an excuse not to upskill - don't fall for it

### Long-Term Development Planning

When planning multi-year skill development:

**The Three-Stage Model:**
1. **Foundations** (Months 1-6): Build basic competence and vocabulary
2. **Deliberate Practice** (Months 7-18): Develop expertise through targeted practice
3. **Application** (Month 19+): Apply expertise to create value and innovate

Reference `references/learning-frameworks.md` section "The Three-Stage Talent Development Model" for details.

**Timeline compression:**
- Standard grade-level pacing is based on inefficient practice
- With serious, efficient training, can compress dramatically
- A year's worth of learning can happen in months with right approach
- Don't let unserious people's timelines discourage you
- BUT: No shortcuts exist - must do the work, just can be efficient

## Key Coaching Mantras

Use these throughout coaching to reinforce principles:

1. **"You're not lazy, you just lack a habit"** - When struggling with consistency
2. **"What prerequisite am I missing?"** - When confused or stuck
3. **"Consuming is only helpful insofar as it enables you to produce"** - When passively learning
4. **"The magic you're looking for is in the full-assed effort you're avoiding"** - When half-assing
5. **"Your missing foundations will wait for you"** - When resisting prerequisite work
6. **"Protect the habit"** - When tempted to skip entirely
7. **"Slow wagon you're on > fast wagon you fell off"** - When considering taking "break"
8. **"Keep your hands on the boulder"** - When doing unrelated work instead of direct practice
9. **"A little extra consistency × a little extra time = massive increase in progress"** - When considering volume increases
10. **"There are no shortcuts, but you can be efficient"** - When looking for easy path

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill complements and can be used alongside:

- **product-coaching**: When learning product management skills
- **life-momentum**: When tracking upskilling as part of overall life progress
- **executive-assistant**: For scheduling practice time and tracking commitments
- Other domain-specific coaching skills

When multiple coaching skills apply, invoke both and synthesize their guidance.

## Common Questions & Responses

**Q: "How long will it take me to get good at [skill]?"**
A: Depends on:
- Your current level and prerequisites
- How consistently you practice (frequency × duration)
- How efficiently you practice (retrieval vs passive review)
- How well you protect the habit
- General timeline: Expect foundations in 1-6 months with serious practice, deliberate practice stage 6-18 months, application thereafter. Can compress with efficient practice.

**Q: "I don't have time to practice every day"**
A: Two responses:
1. 20-30 min daily is enough for serious progress - can you truly not find 20 min?
2. If truly constrained: prioritize consistency (15 min × 5 days) over volume (60 min × 2 days). Build habit first.

**Q: "Should I take a break / I missed several days"**
A: Never take a complete break if you can help it. Do minimum session (5-10 min) to protect the habit. Once you fall off the wagon entirely, you might not get back on. Slow wagon you're on > fast wagon you fell off.

**Q: "This is too hard / I don't think I can learn this"**
A: Two likely scenarios:
1. Missing prerequisites - need to map skill tree and backtrack
2. Jumping too high too fast - need to find appropriate difficulty level
It's not that you can't learn it. It's that you're either missing earlier episodes (prerequisites) or trying to lift too much weight (difficulty level).

**Q: "I'm watching tutorials but not making progress"**
A: Classic passive consumption problem. Everything makes sense while watching because recognition is easy. But can you reproduce it without looking? That's the real test. Implement Efficient Learning Loop: Attempt (without looking) → Check → Correct → Review.

**Q: "How do I stay motivated?"**
A: Motivation is unreliable. Focus on:
1. Building habit so you do it automatically
2. Protecting streak so breaking chain is costly
3. Tracking progress to see compounding
4. Morning practice to eliminate decision fatigue
5. Understanding that enjoyment comes after the work, from results
Reference `references/upskilling-principles.md` section "10. Motivation & Mindset"
