## Current Position Assessment

**Where am I right now?**
[Which rung of the ladder are you actually on? Be honest.]

**What's confusing me?**
[What seems impossible or makes no sense?]

**What prerequisite am I missing?**
[Work backward from confusion to identify the gap]

**What's my next rung?**
[The ONE skill to focus on right now]

---

## Learning Path

Based on your current position and goal:

### Immediate Focus (Next 1-2 months)
1. [Skill to master first]
2. [Skill to master second]
3. [Skill to master third]

### Mid-term Focus (Months 3-6)
1. [Build on foundations]
2. [Layer complexity]
3. [Start advanced work]

### Long-term Focus (Months 6-12)
1. [Advanced applications]
2. [Novel combinations]
3. [Creating value]

## Warning Signs I'm Jumping Too High

Check these periodically:

- [ ] I'm continually confused by "simple" things
- [ ] I can't identify what prerequisites I'm missing
- [ ] I can't execute basics comfortably while doing advanced work
- [ ] I'm spending more time looking things up than applying knowledge
- [ ] Things that should be easy feel impossibly hard
- [ ] I'm frustrated and thinking "I'm just not good at this"

**If 3+ boxes checked**: Stop. Go back down the tree. Fill in prerequisites.

## Mastery Checklist for Each Skill

Before moving to the next rung, can you:

- [ ] Execute it without thinking (automatic)?
- [ ] Explain it to someone else in your own words?
- [ ] Apply it to new contexts/problems?
- [ ] Recognize when to use it?
- [ ] Layer more advanced skills on top of it?

**If not all checked**: Stay on this rung longer. It's not fully solid yet.
