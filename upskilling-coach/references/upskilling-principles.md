# Upskilling Principles

Core principles from "Advice on Upskilling" by Justin Skycak.

## 1. Consistency Over Volume

**You're Not Lazy, You Just Lack a Habit**
- Build habits first, optimize for efficiency later
- Start with enjoyable forms of practice to build consistency
- Eventually transition to more effective but taxing practice
- Protect the habit above all else

**Make the Habit Easily Repeatable**
- Don't make it such a "big thing" that you dread repeating it
- Start with small enough volume that you don't dread the next session
- Gradually increase volume as the habit settles in
- Better to do 30 min/day consistently than 3 hours once

**If You Struggle to Train Consistently, Do It Immediately After Waking Up**
Three key benefits:
1. Shields you from unexpected events that demolish your schedule
2. No time to consider skipping - wheels rolling before conscious brain takes over
3. Clear habit trigger (wake up) and reward (shower, feel good all day)

**Training Sessions Should be Short and Frequent**
- 30 min × 6 days > 90 min × 2 days per week
- Forms stronger habits
- Maintains peak productivity during sessions
- Minimizes forgetting between sessions
- But watch context-switching costs - sessions must be long enough to be productive

**The Virtuous Cycle Formula**
```
Little extra consistency × Little extra time = Massive increase in volume & progress

20 min × 3 days/week = 60 min/week
30 min × 4 days/week = 120 min/week (2× faster)
40 min × 5 days/week = 200 min/week (3.3× faster)
```

**Don't Overreact to Bad Days**
- Even optimal decisions don't win every hand
- Zoom out and look at progress on longer timescales
- One-and-done mistakes won't derail long-term progress
- Repeated mistakes will - learn and adjust

**Protect The Habit**
- Stay consistent even when dialing back volume
- Slow wagon you're on > fast wagon you've fallen off
- Every time you fall off, there's a chance you won't get back on
- Once you've got momentum, do everything to protect it

## 2. Skills Over Credentials

**Hardcore Skills Are Always The Answer**
- Desire is not enough - you need big skills for big impact
- One of the greatest social mobility hacks
- Extra skills needed without connections pay big dividends in the arena

**The "Alien-Level Skills" Hack**
- Provide value nobody else can
- Build broad technical foundations, don't wait to backfill
- Without broad foundations you'll:
  - Underestimate how often advanced tasks come up
  - Fail to identify what approach to take
  - Lose opportunities to others who already have the background
  - Default to cumbersome methods under time pressure

**The Importance of Having Prerequisites In Place**
- Prerequisites make things seem "wait... that's all it is?" vs confusing and inaccessible
- Easy to conflate learning ability with presence/absence of prerequisites
- Opportunities are invisible if you lack prerequisites to see them
- The line between "can't do it" and "can't reach it yet" is prerequisite knowledge

**Most People Don't Realize They Can Systematically Climb Skill Trees**
- Try random stuff in random order, see little progress, give up
- Don't realize every skill tree has trunk and lower branches to climb first
- They think it's a nebulous ether of things they either can or can't do
- Hit ceilings and think they're permanent, not realizing they can climb

**Your Missing Foundations Will Wait For You**
- If you think you don't need prerequisites, go ahead and try
- Try and fail enough to gain humility
- Your missing foundations will wait patiently until you acknowledge them

**The Skills You Need Should Sit Several Layers Deep**
- For mental bandwidth to think deeply, fundamentals must be fluent
- Must lie well beneath your edge of ability
- Can operate at edge, but not comfortably - that's the difference
- Layering advanced skills fortifies underlying structure
- Forces structural integrity and produces deep understanding

## 3. Consuming vs Producing

**Consuming is Only Helpful Insofar as it Enables You to Produce**
- Can't learn to skate by watching videos and reading
- Might become a critic, but not an actual practitioner
- Generalizes to every single skill domain
- Consuming only helps when it enables producing

**Actively Doing is the Key to Alpha**
- Lots of people consume
- Fewer people actively do
- Even fewer attempt challenging things
- Even fewer build foundations to succeed at hard things
- Alpha compounds - success positions you for harder things and more alpha

**Everything Matters**
- Hard and soft skills, big-picture and detail-oriented, technical and creative
- Best results: solid in every category, world-class where you naturally excel
- Lean into strengths AND shore up weaknesses
- Maximizing a product, not a sum
- Running back has to run but blockers also have to block

## 4. Skill Stacking

**You Want Exciting Opportunities? Learn Math and Coding**
- Opens doors you don't know exist
- Future is concentrated on the insanely skilled
- Easiest way to become insanely skilled: skill-stack
- Math and coding pair really well with basically everything

**The Compound Effect**
```
One-in-a-hundred on each of 3 skills = One-in-a-million overall
One-in-a-thousand on each of 3 skills = One-in-a-billion overall
```

**If You're Not Both Technical and a Domain Expert, You're Underpowered**
- Domain expert without building ability: severely underpowered
- Technical without domain expertise: severely underpowered
- Both but separate people: communication/coordination cycles slow and shallow
- Best: Be a technical domain expert working with other technical domain experts

**Domain Expertise, Math, Coding, Communication**
- Domain expertise: identify important problem, envision solution
- Math/coding: build it with technical edge
- Communication: deliver it, articulate value
- Missing any piece limits your impact

## 5. The Grind & Discipline

**The Magic You're Looking For is in the Full-Assed Effort You're Avoiding**
- 30 minutes focused daily can make serious progress
- Must be "full-assed" - intensely focused, continually increasing challenge
- Work intensely enough that you're seriously winded after
- Half-assed effort gets quarter of the results at most

**At Some Point, Doing the Hard Thing Becomes Easier Than Making It Easier**
- Condition: internal willpower ≥ external friction
- Cut out dumb costs and environmental friction first
- But there's always inherent complexity you can't refactor away
- At some point, stop refactoring and lock in to implement
- Some serious trekking will always be involved

**How to Cultivate Discipline**
- Tear down unproductive habits, build counter-habits
- Gradually ease into transitions one step at a time
- Disrupt momentum on negative habits, create momentum toward positive ones
- Example: Wake 5 min earlier for 5 min exercise, gradually expand

**Keep Your Hands On The Boulder**
- Can't move needle on a goal by doing things unrelated to it
- Each goal has its own needle - general exhaustion doesn't count
- Must somehow find it in yourself to directly move the needle
- Boulder is a gigantic reaction ball bouncing everywhere
- Just keep pushing - you WILL gradually wrestle it where it needs to go

**Just Do The F*cking Work**
- Real pros don't try to weasel out of hard work
- Either prove your inherent greatness or fail enough to gain humility
- Can waste time debating or use it to do the work
- Outsized results require outsized work
- Achievement is about transforming from normal to abnormal

## 6. The Learning Process

**The Greatest Educational Life Hack: Learning Ahead of Time**
- Buys you time and mental bandwidth when it counts
- Creates buffer for when life gets chaotic
- Enables helping others and building deeper understanding
- Compounds into massive advantages over time

**The Greatest Breakthrough: Retrieval Practice**
- Learning happens when retrieving from memory, not when consuming
- "Following along" ≠ learning
- Must practice recalling without looking
- Vicious cycle of forgetting if you don't practice retrieval

**The Efficient Learning Loop**
1. Attempt to recall/solve without looking
2. Check answer immediately
3. If wrong, understand why and try similar problem
4. Regular review to maintain long-term retention

**Don't Bloat the Feedback Loop**
- Keep cycles tight between attempt and feedback
- Don't get stuck on overly difficult problems
- Projects can bloat feedback loop - watch for this pitfall
- Review should feel challenging

**Prereq Yo' Self Before You Wreck Yo' Self**
- Fill in foundations - difference between minor potholes vs uncrossable chasms
- Plan broad-strokes journey top-down
- Carry out granular steps bottom-up
- The least efficient learning strategy: "why am I so dumb?" over and over
- More efficient: "what prerequisite am I missing?" and go fill it in

**Learn Like You Lift**
- Progressive overload - gradually increase difficulty
- Need enough challenge to grow, not so much you fail
- Failure is NOT the key to success
- Don't drown yourself in the deep end
- It's about successfully achieving hard things, not just attempting them

## 7. The Journey

**The 3 Stages of Talent Development**
1. Build foundations and basic competence
2. Deliberate practice to develop expertise
3. Apply expertise to create value and innovate

**There Are No Shortcuts**
- Can work efficiently and compress necessary volume
- But cannot skip the work and still get the skills
- Most people are unserious and inefficient
- Don't let unserious timelines discourage you

**No Train, No Gain**
- Ability is built, not unlocked
- Transformation is discomforting
- Enjoyment is a second-order optimization
- The joy of upskilling is like joy of exercise - comes after the work

**Keep Your Foot On The Gas**
- You are a car - either accelerating or decelerating, never steady state
- When you hit a ceiling: fill prerequisites, increase volume, or change approach
- Learn to love the games you were built to win
- Compound hard work and luck
- Get yourself in position where you can eat risk

**Tie Your Comfort to Real, Tangible Value**
- Don't settle for work that doesn't excite you
- If you can't find exciting work, build your skills while you search
- Repetition can lead to expertise, expertise can lead to variety
- Build where building creates more opportunities to build

## 8. Working with Others

**If You're Asking Someone to Be Your Mentor, You're Doing it Wrong**
- Mentorship emerges from demonstrated value, not requests
- Put in work first, show results, then expertise flows naturally
- Best mentorship: compete and collaborate with people slightly ahead

**Put Pressure on Your Boss for More Work**
- Hungry for growth? Make it their problem to feed you
- Shows initiative and ambition
- Accelerates learning curve

**Your Goal is NOT to Prove You're Smart**
- It's to make problems go away
- Make your first impression on contribution, not critique
- Never come up empty-handed
- Bring solutions, not just questions

**You Need a Berserker At The Helm**
- Teams need someone willing to push hard
- Someone who won't settle for "good enough"
- Someone who maintains high standards and urgency

## 9. Common Pitfalls

**The Lie That Learning Should Feel Pleasurable**
- Effective learning is often uncomfortable
- How taxing work becomes fun: after the work, from the results
- Overcoming the paradox: initial suck before the virtuous cycle

**Failure Modes in Math-to-Coding Translation**
1. Difficulty managing complexity when it grows beyond head-fitting
2. Not accepting practical constraints - great becoming enemy of good
3. Getting distracted by low-ROI features/details
4. Being unwilling to do "tedious" grunt work
   - Abstraction astronauts lacking boots-on-the-ground experience
   - Reality contour doesn't match mental model
   - Important things seem negligible, negligible things seem important

**There is Always a Bad Excuse to Rationalize Not Skilling Up**
- AI, lack of time, not the right moment - all excuses
- If you're choosing not to develop skills because of [excuse], you were never going to do it anyway
- You were always going to grasp at the nearest excuse
- Building strong foundational skills provides a massive edge
- Most people just don't want to put in the work

## 10. Motivation & Mindset

**Disinterest is Often Just Overwhelm**
- Break it down into manageable pieces
- Start with what's accessible
- Build confidence through small wins

**You Can Often Just Make Yourself Like Things**
- Create passion through disciplined engagement
- Like developing a close relationship - grows over time
- Keep making short-term progress, long-term sorts itself out

**Why Extrinsic Motivation Matters**
- External validation helps cement identity
- "Damn you're strong" enough times → seeps into identity
- Easy to find motivation for activities that maintain identity
- Applies to all domains: math, coding, music, sports

**The Joy of Upskilling is Like The Joy of Exercise**
- Not necessarily during, but after
- From seeing results
- From others noticing results
- From identity shift that comes from competence

**Why Try When Others Could Do Better?**
- Someone will always be better
- Focus on your own growth curve
- What matters: are you better than you were?
- Are you opening opportunities that were closed before?

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Consistency beats intensity** - Build the habit first, optimize later
2. **Prerequisites unlock everything** - Can't skip rungs on the ladder
3. **Active doing beats passive consuming** - Production, not consumption, builds skill
4. **Full-assed effort required** - Half-assed gets quarter of results
5. **Skill stacking compounds** - Domain expertise + technical skills = opportunities
6. **Retrieval practice is the key** - Learning happens when recalling, not consuming
7. **The journey has stages** - Foundations → Deliberate practice → Application
8. **Protect the habit** - Never fully fall off the wagon
9. **Keep hands on the boulder** - Direct effort on the goal, no substitutes
10. **No shortcuts, but can be efficient** - Must do the work, but can compress timeline
