## Coaching for Transformation

### Assessing Transformation Readiness

**Key Questions**:
1. Does CEO understand and support product operating model?
2. Are product leaders ready to coach vs. command?
3. Is technology seen as strategic enabler?
4. Are stakeholders willing to collaborate differently?
5. Can we create pilot team(s) with real work?

**Red Flags**:
- "We just need better process"
- "Our people aren't capable"
- "We can't change commitments"
- "Technology is just implementation"
- Leadership unwilling to change

### Coaching Pilot Teams

- Identify critical gaps
- Establish coaching cadence
- Set transformation objectives

**Month 1: Discovery Focus**

- Conduct user research together
- Practice rapid experimentation
- Build validation muscles

**Month 2-3: Strategy and Autonomy**

- Increase team autonomy

**Month 4+: Independence and Results**

- Scale to additional teams

### Common Transformation Obstacles

**Obstacle**: "We don't have time for discovery"
**Coaching Response**: Discovery saves time by preventing waste. Start with 20% of capacity, prove value, expand.

**Obstacle**: "Stakeholders want features, not outcomes"
**Coaching Response**: Show outcomes deliver better results. Educate stakeholders on new model. Demonstrate with quick wins.

**Obstacle**: "Our people aren't ready"
**Coaching Response**: Competency grows through practice with coaching. Start where they are, build capability progressively.

**Obstacle**: "We have too many commitments"
**Coaching Response**: Honest conversation about capacity. Phase transition. Prove new model delivers more value.

**Obstacle**: "Leadership doesn't understand"
**Coaching Response**: Educate with evidence. Use pilot results. Connect to business outcomes they care about.
