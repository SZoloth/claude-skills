### Coaching Questions Library

- "Which users did you observe?"
- "Can you show me the evidence?"
- "Is that validated or is that a hypothesis?"

**For Prioritization**:
- "Why this over other options?"
- "What's the strategic value beyond tactical pain?"
- "If you could only fix one thing, why this?"

**For User Understanding**:
- "When did you last talk to a user about this?"
- "What surprised you in user research?"
- "How would users describe this problem?"

**For Team Collaboration**:
- "Who else should be involved in this?"
