# Evidence Extraction Template

Use this template during and after user observation/interview sessions to document evidence properly.

## Session Info

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**User/Participant**: [Name, Role]
**Context**: [What you were observing - e.g., "Package submission workflow"]
**Duration**: [Minutes]
**Method**: Observation / Interview / Think-aloud / Diary study

## Observed Behaviors

Use this section to capture what you SAW (not what you think it means).

### Action: [Specific step in workflow]

**What user did**:
- [Exact actions observed - clicks, navigation, etc.]

**Time spent**: [If relevant]

**Struggles/Friction observed**:
- [Where they hesitated, clicked multiple times, cursed, etc.]

**Workarounds used**:
- [Unexpected behaviors, tools outside the system]

**Direct quote** (if available):
- "[Verbatim quote from user]"

**Evidence citation**: `[session-file-name]:[timestamp or line number]`

---

### Action: [Next step in workflow]

[Repeat structure above]

---

## Pain Points (Evidence-Based)

For each pain point you identify, use this structure:

### Pain Point #1: [Short descriptive title]

**Observable behavior**:
- [What you saw that indicates this is painful]

**User quote**:
- "[Verbatim quote if available]"

**Frequency**:
- [ ] Every time (100%)
- [ ] Most times (>75%)
- [ ] Sometimes (25-75%)
- [ ] Rarely (<25%)
- [ ] Unknown - needs more observation

**Impact**:
- **Time cost**: [How much time this adds/wastes]
- **Error risk**: [Does this cause mistakes? How often?]
- **Workaround needed**: [Do users have to use external tools?]
- **Emotional reaction**: [Frustration level - direct quote if available]

**Evidence citation**: `[session-file-name]:[location]`

**Confidence level**:
- [ ] Validated (observed multiple times across users)
- [ ] Strong (observed clearly in this session)
- [ ] Hypothesis (inferred from user comment, needs validation)

---

## Questions Raised

Questions you need to answer with future sessions:

- [ ] [Specific question about user behavior]
- [ ] [Specific question about workflow]
- [ ] [Specific question about pain point frequency/impact]

## Surprising Findings

What didn't match your expectations?

- [Unexpected behaviors]
- [Workarounds you didn't know about]
- [Pain points you didn't anticipate]
- [Features users love that you thought were problematic]

## Hypotheses to Test

Based on what you observed, what do you want to validate next?

- [ ] Hypothesis: [Testable statement]
  - **How to test**: [Method]
  - **Expected outcome if true**: [What you'd observe]

## Next Actions

**For this user**:
- [ ] Follow-up question to ask
- [ ] Specific scenario to observe next time

**For research**:
- [ ] Other users to observe with similar/different contexts
- [ ] Specific workflows to focus on
- [ ] Validation needed for hypotheses

## Template Usage Guide

### DO's ✅
- ✅ Use user's actual words in quotes
- ✅ Describe observable behaviors, not interpretations
- ✅ Quantify when possible (time, clicks, frequency)
- ✅ Note emotional reactions (verbatim quotes best)
- ✅ Cite source with session ID and location
- ✅ Flag confidence level (validated vs. hypothesis)
- ✅ Note surprises and unexpected findings

### DON'Ts ❌
- ❌ Interpret user's intentions ("they wanted to...")
- ❌ Use framework language user didn't say ("context switching")
- ❌ Generalize from one observation ("users always...")
- ❌ Add details not in evidence ("recently", "often")
- ❌ Mix assumptions into evidence section
- ❌ Skip citation information
- ❌ Present hypotheses as facts

### Example: Good vs. Bad Evidence

**❌ Bad Evidence** (assumption-based):
> "Navigation is tedious and frustrating for users. They often get lost trying to find the import dialog. This creates inefficiency."

**✅ Good Evidence** (observation-based):
> **Pain Point**: Users spend 2-4 minutes locating import dialog in Courier UI
>
> **Observable behavior**: Melissa clicked through 3 different menu locations before finding import option; said "Where is it again?" while searching
>
> **User quote**: "I always forget where the import button is. I wish it was more obvious." (melissa-walkthrough-2025-11-14:23)
>
> **Frequency**: Observed in 3 of 4 sessions so far
>
> **Impact**:
> - Time cost: 2-4 minutes per package submission
> - Emotional reaction: Frustration (mild, but consistent)
>
> **Confidence**: Strong (multiple observations)

## Quick Reference: Evidence Quality Checklist

Before considering evidence "complete," check:

- [ ] Observable behavior described (not interpretation)
- [ ] User quote included (verbatim, with citation)
- [ ] Frequency estimated or flagged as unknown
- [ ] Impact quantified (time/errors/workaround)
- [ ] Source cited (session file and location)
- [ ] Confidence level indicated
- [ ] Assumptions separated from observations
- [ ] No framework language user didn't use
- [ ] No fabricated details added

**Standard**: If you can't cite it, you can't claim it.
