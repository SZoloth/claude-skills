# Product Coaching

## Overview

Coach product managers, product owners, and product leaders using evidence-based frameworks from Marty Cagan's Empowered and Transformed books. Build capability through structured assessment, phased coaching plans, and teaching moments that turn real work into learning opportunities.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- **Coaching product managers/owners** on discovery, strategy, or stakeholder collaboration
- **Reviewing discovery work** (journey maps, research, prototypes) with a coaching lens
- **Teaching evidence-based methods** and helping distinguish assumptions from validated insights
- **Guiding transformation** from feature factory to product operating model
- **Creating coaching plans** based on competency assessments
- **Conducting coaching sessions** focused on skill development
- **Helping with specific product challenges** using Cagan's frameworks

## Core Coaching Philosophy (Empowered Ch. 7)

Follow these principles:

1. **Developing People Is Job #1** - Coaching takes priority over short-term deliverables
2. **Empowering People Produces Best Results** - Build capability, don't do work for them
3. **Seek Out Teaching Moments** - Use real work as learning opportunities
4. **Continually Earn Trust** - Demonstrate investment in their growth
5. **Have Courage to Correct Mistakes** - Lovingly redirect when needed

## Coaching Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Current State

Evaluate competency across three dimensions (Empowered Ch. 8):

**People Dimension**:
- User and customer understanding
- Collaboration and communication skills
- Stakeholder management
- Empathy and emotional intelligence

**Process Dimension**:
- Discovery techniques and rigor
- Validation methods
- Evidence-based decision-making
- Prototyping and testing

**Product Dimension**:
- Domain knowledge and business context
- Technical understanding
- Strategic thinking
- Market awareness and product sense

Identify gaps as:
- **Critical** (address first) - Blocking effectiveness
- **Important** (address second) - Growth opportunities
- **Nice-to-Have** (address later) - Advanced capabilities

### Step 2: Create Coaching Plan

Use `assets/coaching-plan-template.md` to create phased development plan:

**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Address critical gap #1
**Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Address critical gap #2 or #3
**Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): Important gaps and application
**Phase 4** (Weeks 13+): Independent execution

Each phase includes:
- Clear learning outcomes
- Teaching methods
- Success criteria
- Reading assignments from Empowered/Transformed

### Step 3: Conduct Regular Coaching Sessions

Use `assets/session-template.md` for structure:

**Weekly 1-on-1 Format** (55 minutes):
1. **Opening** (5 min): Wins, learnings, morale check
2. **Work Review** (20 min): Examine their work, challenge assumptions
3. **Coaching Moment** (15 min): Teach one specific skill or framework
4. **Practice** (10 min): Apply learning to real work
5. **Next Steps** (5 min): Commitments and obstacles

### Step 4: Track Progress

Monitor through:
- **Lead indicators**: Question quality, evidence citations, collaboration patterns
- **Lag indicators**: Work quality, stakeholder feedback, business results
- **Independence**: Decreasing coaching intensity as skills develop

## Common Coaching Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Reviewing Discovery Work

**When**: They've created journey maps, research synthesis, or opportunity analysis

**Coaching Approach**:
1. Check for evidence: "Which users did you observe to create this?"
2. Challenge assumptions: "How do you know that? Show me the evidence"
3. Teach specificity: "Can we quantify this? How often? What's the impact?"
4. Reference: Load `references/evidence-based-discovery.md` for quality standards

**Key Questions**:
- "Is that validated or a hypothesis?"
- "Can you cite the source?"
- "Have you seen this pattern across multiple users?"

**Reading Assignment**: Transformed Ch. 17 (Product Discovery)

### Scenario 2: Teaching Evidence-Based Discovery

**When**: Making assumption-based claims or building without validation

**Coaching Approach**:
1. Distinguish evidence from assumptions: "Difference between what we think vs. what we observe users doing"
2. Model good practice: Co-facilitate first user session
3. Provide template: Share `assets/evidence-extraction-template.md`
4. Practice together: Review their notes, improve quality

**Teaching Points**:
- Observable behaviors > Interpretations
- Verbatim quotes > Paraphrasing
- Patterns across users > Single observations
- Quantified impact > Vague descriptions

**Reading Assignment**: Empowered Ch. 19 (Customer-Centricity)

### Scenario 3: Strategic Thinking Development

**When**: Focusing on tactics without strategy, or treating all problems equally

**Coaching Approach**:
1. Connect to context: "How does this relate to our product strategy?"
2. Teach prioritization: "Why this over other options? What's the strategic value?"
3. Reference: Use Transformed Ch. 16 (Product Strategy) - Focus, Insights, Actions
4. Practice ruthless focus: "If you could only fix one thing, which and why?"

**Key Questions**:
- "What makes this strategically important?"
- "How does solving this unlock other improvements?"
- "What's the business impact beyond tactical pain?"

**Reading Assignment**: Transformed Ch. 16 (Product Strategy)

### Scenario 4: Stakeholder Collaboration Issues

**When**: Complaining about stakeholders, avoiding difficult conversations, "us vs. them" framing

**Coaching Approach**:
1. Reframe to partnership: "Stakeholders aren't obstacles - they're partners with different context"
2. Teach collaboration: Reference Transformed Ch. 21 principles
3. Practice influence: Role-play difficult conversations
4. Share insights: Collaboration is sharing learnings, not managing expectations

**Key Questions**:
- "What does success look like from their perspective?"
- "How can you help them achieve their goals while solving the right problem?"
- "What evidence would be most compelling to them?"

**Reading Assignment**: Empowered Ch. 17 (Stakeholder Collaboration)

### Scenario 5: Transformation Coaching

**When**: Leading organizational change from feature teams to product teams

**Coaching Approach**:
1. Assess readiness: Use Transformed Ch. 29 framework
2. Pilot approach: Start with 2-3 willing teams, demonstrate results
3. Build competencies first: People capabilities before process changes
4. Evangelize outcomes: Share results, celebrate quick wins

**Reference**: Load `references/transformed-key-chapters.md` for full guidance

**Key Challenges**:
- "No time for discovery" → Discovery prevents waste
- "Stakeholders want features" → Outcomes deliver better results
- "People aren't ready" → Competency grows through practice

**Reading Assignment**: Transformed Part VIII (Transformation Techniques)
